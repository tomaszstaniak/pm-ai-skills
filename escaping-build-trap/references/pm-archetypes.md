# Product Manager Archetypes

Melissa Perri identifies four PM archetypes in "Escaping the Build Trap." Each archetype describes a pattern of behavior, not a permanent identity. PMs can — and do — shift between archetypes depending on organizational context, coaching, and self-awareness. Understanding these archetypes is essential for diagnosing why product management is underperforming and what to do about it.

## The Four Archetypes

### The Waiter

**Core behavior:** Takes orders from stakeholders and translates them into requirements for engineering. Does not question whether the requested feature is the right thing to build. Measures success by stakeholder satisfaction and on-time delivery.

**How they spend their time:**
- 50% writing specifications based on stakeholder requests
- 25% managing the backlog and grooming tickets
- 15% in status meetings reporting progress
- 10% coordinating between stakeholders and engineering

**Behavioral indicators:**
- Describes their role as "gathering requirements" or "being the voice of the business"
- Cannot articulate why a feature is being built beyond "stakeholder X requested it"
- Backlog is a prioritized list of stakeholder requests, not validated problems
- Rarely or never talks to end users directly
- Feels uncomfortable saying "no" to any request from leadership or sales
- Defines success as "we shipped what was asked for on time"
- Sprint planning consists of pulling the next items from the stakeholder-driven queue
- When asked "what problem does this solve?" responds with "the business needs it"

**What creates this archetype:** Organizations that treat product management as a service function. When PMs are hired to "translate business needs into tech requirements," they become Waiters by design. Sales-driven cultures with strong HiPPO dynamics produce Waiters at scale.

**The danger:** Waiters build exactly what is asked for, which is rarely what is needed. They create a false sense of alignment — everyone agrees on what to build, but no one validates whether it should be built.

### The Former Project Manager

**Core behavior:** Focuses on process, timelines, and delivery coordination. Excellent at getting things shipped on schedule but does not engage with the "what" or "why" — only the "when" and "how much."

**How they spend their time:**
- 40% managing timelines, dependencies, and delivery coordination
- 25% running standups, sprint ceremonies, and status updates
- 20% updating project tracking tools and generating reports
- 15% escalating blockers and managing risks

**Behavioral indicators:**
- Conversations center on dates, velocity, and sprint capacity
- Treats the product backlog as a project plan with deadlines
- Measures team performance by velocity or story points completed
- Comfortable with Gantt charts and release trains, uncomfortable with customer interviews
- When a feature ships late, sees it as a failure; when it ships on time but has no impact, does not notice
- Speaks in terms of "deliverables" and "milestones" rather than "outcomes" and "hypotheses"
- Runs efficient meetings but the meetings are about delivery status, not learning
- Rarely challenges the scope or necessity of work items

**What creates this archetype:** Organizations that promote project managers into PM roles without redefining expectations. Also common in companies where "agile transformation" added PM titles to existing project management functions without changing the underlying work.

**The danger:** The Former Project Manager keeps the machine running smoothly but never asks whether the machine is pointed in the right direction. Teams ship consistently but the shipped work does not compound into meaningful product improvement.

### The Mini-CEO

**Core behavior:** Believes they are the ultimate decision-maker for the product. Dictates solutions to engineering rather than collaborating on problem-solving. Treats designers and engineers as execution resources.

**How they spend their time:**
- 35% making product decisions unilaterally and creating detailed specifications
- 25% presenting their vision to stakeholders and defending their choices
- 20% reviewing engineering output and providing feedback on implementation
- 20% competitive analysis and strategy work (done in isolation)

**Behavioral indicators:**
- Uses the phrase "my product" frequently
- Creates detailed mockups or specifications before involving design or engineering
- Views pushback from the team as resistance rather than valuable input
- Makes prioritization decisions based on personal conviction rather than evidence
- Treats customer research as validation for decisions already made, not as input for discovery
- Gets defensive when their ideas are questioned
- Engineers and designers feel like "hands" rather than collaborators
- Strategy work happens in the PM's head or documents, not in collaborative sessions

**What creates this archetype:** The outdated "CEO of the product" framing that was popular in early product management literature. Also created when organizations give PMs authority without accountability for outcomes — they have the power to decide but are not measured on whether decisions work.

**The danger:** The Mini-CEO bottlenecks innovation through one person's judgment. They miss insights from engineering and design, ignore evidence that contradicts their vision, and demoralize teams by treating them as implementation resources.

### The Strategic PM

**Core behavior:** Operates at the intersection of business viability, customer desirability, and technical feasibility. Frames work around problems and outcomes, not features. Collaborates deeply with engineering and design. Uses evidence to inform decisions. Connects team-level work to company strategy.

**How they spend their time:**
- 30% discovery work (customer interviews, data analysis, experimentation design)
- 25% strategy and alignment (connecting team work to company objectives, stakeholder communication)
- 25% collaboration with engineering and design (problem framing, solution exploration, trade-off discussions)
- 20% delivery support (prioritization, scope decisions, removing blockers)

**Behavioral indicators:**
- Frames conversations around "what problem are we solving?" and "how will we know it worked?"
- Can articulate the strategic context for every major piece of work
- Brings evidence (customer quotes, data, experiment results) to prioritization discussions
- Engineers and designers describe the PM as a true partner, not a boss or a secretary
- Regularly says "I do not know — let us find out"
- Comfortable with ambiguity and iteration
- Measures success by outcome metrics, not delivery metrics
- Stakeholders trust them because they bring insight, not because they say yes to everything

**What creates this archetype:** Organizations that define PM roles around outcomes, invest in PM development, and create environments where discovery is valued alongside delivery. Strategic PMs also emerge from individual initiative — PMs who push against organizational gravity to do the right work.

## Self-Assessment: Which Archetype Am I?

Answer each question honestly. Choose the response that best describes your actual behavior, not your aspirational behavior.

### Question 1: A senior stakeholder asks you to add a specific feature. What do you do first?

- **(a)** Add it to the backlog and prioritize it based on the stakeholder's seniority. → Waiter
- **(b)** Estimate the effort and figure out when it can fit into the schedule. → Former Project Manager
- **(c)** Evaluate it against your product vision and decide whether to include it. → Mini-CEO
- **(d)** Ask what problem the stakeholder is trying to solve and what evidence suggests this feature would solve it. → Strategic PM

### Question 2: How do you know a quarter was successful?

- **(a)** Stakeholders are happy with what was delivered. → Waiter
- **(b)** We shipped everything on the roadmap on time. → Former Project Manager
- **(c)** The features I advocated for are live and getting positive feedback. → Mini-CEO
- **(d)** Our target outcome metrics moved in the right direction. → Strategic PM

### Question 3: When did you last talk to a customer?

- **(a)** I do not talk to customers directly — I get requirements from stakeholders. → Waiter
- **(b)** I attended a customer meeting once, but it was mostly about delivery timelines. → Former Project Manager
- **(c)** I did a demo of the product to validate that my approach was right. → Mini-CEO
- **(d)** This week, as part of ongoing discovery. → Strategic PM

### Question 4: How do you handle disagreement with your engineering lead?

- **(a)** I defer — my job is to bring them the requirements, not to debate. → Waiter
- **(b)** I focus on scope and timeline impact — can we still hit the date? → Former Project Manager
- **(c)** I explain my reasoning and expect them to execute my decision. → Mini-CEO
- **(d)** I explore their perspective — they may have context I lack, and we work through the trade-offs together. → Strategic PM

### Question 5: What does your product roadmap look like?

- **(a)** A list of features requested by various stakeholders, loosely prioritized. → Waiter
- **(b)** A timeline with milestones, dependencies, and delivery dates. → Former Project Manager
- **(c)** A vision document with the features I believe will win the market. → Mini-CEO
- **(d)** A set of outcome goals with options and experiments beneath each one. → Strategic PM

### Question 6: How do you spend the first two hours of your workday?

- **(a)** Checking email and Slack for new requests from stakeholders. → Waiter
- **(b)** Reviewing the sprint board and checking for blockers or timeline risks. → Former Project Manager
- **(c)** Working on product strategy documents or feature specifications. → Mini-CEO
- **(d)** Reviewing experiment results, preparing for a customer interview, or analyzing usage data. → Strategic PM

### Question 7: How do you describe your role to someone outside the company?

- **(a)** "I make sure the product team builds what the business needs." → Waiter
- **(b)** "I keep the product development process running smoothly." → Former Project Manager
- **(c)** "I decide what the product should be and drive the vision." → Mini-CEO
- **(d)** "I figure out which problems are worth solving and work with the team to find the best solutions." → Strategic PM

### Scoring

Count your answers by archetype. Your dominant archetype is the one with the most answers. If you have a tie, read the detailed descriptions above and identify which behavioral pattern resonates most strongly.

Note: Most PMs are a blend. The goal is not to be 100% Strategic PM in every answer — it is to recognize your default patterns and consciously expand your repertoire.

## Coaching Strategies for Moving Toward the Strategic PM Archetype

### Coaching the Waiter

**Root cause to address:** The Waiter believes their value comes from making stakeholders happy by delivering what is asked for. They need to redefine their value as making stakeholders successful by solving the right problems.

**Coaching steps:**

1. **Build confidence through small wins.** Ask the Waiter to pick one stakeholder request and spend two hours understanding the underlying problem. Help them present back to the stakeholder: "You asked for X. The problem you are trying to solve seems to be Y. Here are three ways we could solve Y, including X." Most stakeholders respond positively to this.

2. **Teach the problem interview.** Give the Waiter a script for a 20-minute customer interview focused on understanding problems, not validating features. Have them conduct three interviews and share what they learned. The act of hearing customer problems directly changes how Waiters see their role.

3. **Create safety for saying no.** The Waiter needs organizational permission to push back. Work with their manager to explicitly state: "We expect you to evaluate requests, not just accept them. We will support you when you recommend against something with evidence."

4. **Shift the reporting structure.** Instead of reporting "we shipped features A, B, and C," help the Waiter report "we are working on problem X. Here is what we have learned. Here is what we are trying next." This changes the conversation from output to outcome.

**Timeline:** Expect 3-6 months for a Waiter to develop Strategic PM behaviors with consistent coaching.

### Coaching the Former Project Manager

**Root cause to address:** The Former Project Manager conflates delivery discipline with product management. They need to learn that delivery is necessary but insufficient — the harder question is what to deliver.

**Coaching steps:**

1. **Redefine success metrics.** Work with the Former Project Manager to add one outcome metric to their regular reporting alongside their delivery metrics. Ask them to track both for a quarter and observe the relationship (or lack thereof) between delivery speed and outcome improvement.

2. **Introduce discovery as a first-class activity.** Add "discovery capacity" to sprint planning. Reserve 15-20% of team capacity for research, prototyping, and experimentation. Help the Former Project Manager treat this as real work, not overhead.

3. **Practice the "so what?" question.** After every shipped feature, ask: "So what? What changed for the customer? How do we know?" This builds the habit of connecting delivery to impact.

4. **Reduce ceremony, increase substance.** Help the Former Project Manager eliminate or shorten process-heavy meetings and redirect that time to customer conversations and strategy discussions.

**Timeline:** Expect 2-4 months. Former Project Managers often have strong organizational skills that translate well to strategic work once they redirect their focus.

### Coaching the Mini-CEO

**Root cause to address:** The Mini-CEO believes that individual judgment is the highest-value input to product decisions. They need to learn that evidence-informed collaboration produces better outcomes than solo decision-making.

**Coaching steps:**

1. **Make it about outcomes, not ego.** Frame the shift as "being right more often," not "giving up control." Show examples where customer research or engineering input led to better solutions than the initial PM vision.

2. **Require evidence for prioritization decisions.** Institute a rule: every priority decision must be accompanied by at least one piece of customer evidence (interview quote, usage data, support ticket pattern). This creates a structural incentive to gather evidence.

3. **Facilitate collaborative design sessions.** Put the Mini-CEO in structured sessions where engineers and designers contribute solution ideas. Help them see that the best solution often comes from the team, not from any single person.

4. **Separate vision from specification.** Help the Mini-CEO channel their strategic thinking into vision and problem framing (where individual perspective is valuable) and step back from solution specification (where collaboration produces better results).

**Timeline:** Expect 4-8 months. Mini-CEOs often resist coaching because they see it as diminishing their role. Progress requires patience and a focus on outcomes — when the Mini-CEO sees that collaborative approaches yield better results, they begin to shift.

## How to Hire for the Strategic PM Archetype

### Interview Questions That Reveal Archetype

| Question | Waiter Signal | Project Manager Signal | Mini-CEO Signal | Strategic PM Signal |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Tell me about a feature you decided NOT to build." | Cannot provide an example | Talks about scope cuts for timeline reasons | Talks about their judgment call | Talks about evidence that showed the feature would not solve the problem |
| "How do you handle a request from the CEO that you disagree with?" | "I would build it — they know the business" | "I would estimate it and fit it in" | "I would push back hard — I know the product" | "I would understand their concern, share what I know, and propose we test the assumption" |
| "Walk me through how you decided what to build last quarter." | Describes stakeholder requests | Describes capacity planning | Describes their product vision | Describes problem discovery and outcome goals |
| "What was your biggest product failure?" | "We missed a deadline" | "A project went over budget" | "People did not understand my vision" | "We built something that did not change the metric we targeted — here is what we learned" |

### Red Flags in PM Candidates

- Cannot describe a time they changed their mind based on evidence
- Define success exclusively in delivery terms
- Have never conducted a customer interview
- Describe their team as resources to manage rather than partners to collaborate with
- Cannot connect their work to business outcomes

### Green Flags in PM Candidates

- Naturally ask "why?" and "how do we know?"
- Describe failures in terms of outcomes, not timelines
- Give credit to their team for good solutions
- Can articulate trade-offs they navigated, not just decisions they made
- Show genuine curiosity about customers and their problems

## When a PM Is in the Wrong Archetype for the Situation

Sometimes the problem is not the PM — it is the fit between the PM's current archetype and the situation's requirements.

### When You Need a Waiter (Temporarily)

In rare cases, the Waiter archetype is appropriate: during regulatory-driven work where requirements are externally defined, during platform migrations where the scope is predetermined, or during the first 30 days in a new role when learning the landscape. Even here, the goal is to move toward Strategic PM behaviors as quickly as the situation allows.

### When the Organization Creates the Wrong Archetype

If you hire Strategic PMs and they become Waiters within six months, the problem is organizational, not individual. Check for:

- **Reward structures** that celebrate delivery over outcomes
- **Planning processes** that assign features rather than problems
- **Stakeholder dynamics** that punish pushback
- **Time allocation** that leaves no room for discovery
- **Org design** that positions PMs as coordinators rather than leaders

Fix the system before blaming the individual. A Strategic PM in a Waiter-producing organization will either become a Waiter, burn out, or leave.

### The Archetype Transition Plan

For a PM transitioning to the Strategic archetype, create a 90-day plan:

**Days 1-30:** Awareness. Complete the self-assessment. Identify two behaviors to change. Start a weekly customer interview cadence (at least one per week).

**Days 31-60:** Practice. Add one outcome metric to team goals. Conduct a problem-framing workshop with the team. Present one evidence-based recommendation to stakeholders (even a small one).

**Days 61-90:** Integration. Restructure the roadmap around outcomes. Run a discovery sprint on the team's biggest assumption. Report to stakeholders on outcomes and learning, not just delivery.

**Review at 90 days:** Retake the self-assessment. Compare results. Identify the next set of behaviors to develop.

The transition is not a one-time event. It requires ongoing practice, organizational support, and the courage to work differently even when the system incentivizes the old patterns.
