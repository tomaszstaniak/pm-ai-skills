# Guiding Policy: Turning Diagnosis Into Direction

A guiding policy is the bridge between understanding a challenge and taking action. It is an overall approach chosen to deal with the obstacle identified in the diagnosis. Rumelt describes it as a signpost — it doesn't tell you exactly where to go, but it tells you the general direction and, critically, which directions are ruled out. A guiding policy without trade-offs is not a strategy. It is a wish.

## What Makes a Guiding Policy Effective

An effective guiding policy has five characteristics:

1. **It addresses the diagnosis.** The policy responds to the specific critical challenge identified, not to a generic business problem.
2. **It creates advantage through focus.** By channeling efforts in one direction, it concentrates force where it matters.
3. **It rules things out.** A policy that accommodates everything guides nothing. The power comes from what you decide not to do.
4. **It is stable enough to coordinate.** Teams can use it to make independent decisions because the direction is clear and will not shift next quarter.
5. **It exploits leverage.** It directs effort toward the point where concentrated action has the highest payoff given the diagnosis.

A guiding policy is not a vision statement, a set of goals, or a list of priorities. It is a decision about how the organization will approach its most critical challenge.

## The Opposite Test

The most practical test for whether a guiding policy is real: state the opposite, and ask whether any reasonable organization might choose that opposite.

| Guiding Policy | Opposite | Real Strategy? |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| "We will focus on the enterprise segment and deprioritize self-serve" | "We will focus on self-serve and deprioritize enterprise" | Yes — both are viable approaches. This is a real choice. |
| "We will deliver high-quality products" | "We will deliver low-quality products" | No — nobody would choose the opposite. This is not a strategy. |
| "We will win through deep integration with customer workflows rather than breadth of features" | "We will win through breadth of features rather than deep integration" | Yes — these are genuinely different approaches. Real strategy. |
| "We will grow by being customer-centric" | "We will grow by ignoring customers" | No — this is a platitude, not a strategy. |
| "We will compete on speed of implementation, accepting lower customization" | "We will compete on deep customization, accepting longer implementation" | Yes — real trade-off between two defensible positions. |

If the opposite of your guiding policy sounds absurd, you do not have a guiding policy. You have a statement of values or aspirations. These may be important, but they are not strategy.

## Trade-Off Identification and Articulation

Michael Porter argues that the essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. Trade-offs arise for three reasons:

1. **Inconsistencies in image or reputation.** A company known for luxury cannot simultaneously be known for bargain pricing without confusing customers and damaging credibility.
2. **Differences in required activities.** Serving enterprise customers requires a sales team, implementation support, and compliance certifications. Serving self-serve customers requires frictionless onboarding, product-led growth mechanics, and low-touch support. Doing both well requires two different operating models.
3. **Limits on internal coordination.** When an organization tries to serve two different value propositions, managers get mixed signals about priorities. Resource allocation becomes a political negotiation rather than a strategic decision.

### How to Identify Your Trade-Offs

Ask these questions:

- **What do our best customers value most?** Now ask: what do they not care about? The things they don't care about are candidates for deprioritization.
- **What would we have to give up to be the best at one thing?** If the answer is "nothing," you haven't found the trade-off yet.
- **Where do our resource allocation decisions conflict?** If engineering time spent on Feature A directly reduces capacity for Feature B, and both are "priorities," you have an unresolved trade-off.
- **What do our competitors do that we refuse to do?** If the answer is "nothing — we try to do everything they do," you do not have a strategy.

### Articulating Trade-Offs Clearly

A well-articulated trade-off follows this pattern:

> "We choose [approach A] over [approach B] because [our diagnosis tells us that approach A addresses the critical challenge while approach B does not]."

Examples:

- "We choose depth of integration with Salesforce over breadth of CRM integrations because our diagnosis tells us that switching costs, not feature breadth, drive retention in our market."
- "We choose serving mid-market companies (100-1000 employees) over enterprise or SMB because our diagnosis tells us this segment is underserved by solutions that are too simple (SMB tools) or too complex (enterprise tools), and our team's domain expertise gives us an asymmetric advantage here."
- "We choose to invest in developer experience over end-user polish because our diagnosis tells us that developer adoption drives purchasing decisions in our market, and our current developer experience is the primary bottleneck to growth."

## Translating a Guiding Policy Into Decision Criteria

A guiding policy is only useful if teams can apply it without asking leadership for permission on every decision. The translation from policy to decision criteria is where most strategies fail — not because the policy is wrong, but because it never becomes operational.

### The Decision Criteria Framework

For each guiding policy, derive three to five decision criteria that teams can use autonomously:

| Guiding Policy | Decision Criteria |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Win through speed of deployment" | 1. When choosing between faster shipping and more features, choose faster shipping. 2. When a process adds time without reducing critical risk, remove it. 3. When scoping a project, the smallest deployable unit ships first. |
| "Focus on the mid-market segment" | 1. Feature requests from enterprise customers are logged but not prioritized unless they also serve mid-market. 2. Pricing is optimized for mid-market budgets, not enterprise procurement. 3. Sales collateral emphasizes ROI at mid-market scale. |
| "Compete on integration depth" | 1. New integrations are evaluated on depth (how many workflows they support), not breadth (how many platforms they connect to). 2. Engineering spends at least 40% of capacity on integration infrastructure. 3. Customer success measures adoption of integration features, not just login frequency. |

### Testing Decision Criteria

For each criterion, ask:
- **Is it specific enough to resolve an actual disagreement?** If two reasonable people would interpret it the same way, it passes.
- **Does it produce different behavior than the default?** If teams would do the same thing without the criterion, it is not adding value.
- **Can a team lead apply it without escalation?** If every application requires VP approval, the criterion is too vague.

## Porter's Perspective: Strategy as Unique Position

Porter defines strategic positioning as performing different activities from rivals, or performing similar activities in different ways. Three bases for positioning:

### 1. Variety-Based Positioning

Serving a subset of needs for a wide range of customers. The guiding policy centers on being the best at one type of product or service.

**Example:** A project management tool that only serves software development teams (not marketing, HR, or general use). The guiding policy: "We build exclusively for software teams, integrating deeply with development workflows (Git, CI/CD, code review) rather than building general-purpose project management features."

### 2. Needs-Based Positioning

Serving most or all of the needs of a particular customer segment. The guiding policy centers on understanding and serving a specific group better than anyone else.

**Example:** A fintech platform for freelancers that handles invoicing, tax estimation, health insurance, and retirement planning. The guiding policy: "We serve every financial need of independent workers, building a single platform that replaces the five separate tools they currently use."

### 3. Access-Based Positioning

Serving customers who are accessible in a distinctive way — by geography, scale, or channel.

**Example:** A healthcare SaaS company serving rural clinics with limited IT staff. The guiding policy: "We design for organizations with zero dedicated IT, providing fully managed infrastructure and phone-based support rather than self-serve documentation."

The guiding policy should make it clear which positioning basis the organization is pursuing. Trying to pursue all three simultaneously is a sign of strategic confusion.

## Examples of Strong vs. Weak Guiding Policies

### Example 1: E-Commerce Company

**Weak:** "We will provide the best customer experience in e-commerce."

**Why it's weak:** Every e-commerce company claims this. It fails the opposite test. It provides no guidance on trade-offs.

**Strong:** "We will optimize for repeat purchase rate over new customer acquisition. Every investment decision prioritizes retention and reorder ease over top-of-funnel growth. We accept slower customer acquisition in exchange for higher lifetime value."

**Why it's strong:** It creates a clear trade-off (retention over acquisition), passes the opposite test (acquisition-first is a viable alternative), and provides decision criteria teams can use (when in doubt, prioritize the existing customer).

### Example 2: Developer Tools Company

**Weak:** "We will build a world-class developer platform."

**Strong:** "We will reduce the time from 'first API call' to 'production deployment' to under one hour. We prioritize getting-started speed over configurability. We ship opinionated defaults rather than flexible options."

**Why it's strong:** It identifies a specific metric (time to production), makes a clear trade-off (speed over configurability), and gives engineers a decision rule (opinionated defaults over flexible options).

### Example 3: Healthcare Technology

**Weak:** "We will leverage AI to transform healthcare."

**Strong:** "We will reduce diagnostic error rates in radiology by embedding AI-assisted second reads into the existing PACS workflow. We compete on integration with current clinical workflows, not on standalone AI accuracy. We accept lower performance on benchmarks in exchange for higher adoption by radiologists who will not change their workflow."

**Why it's strong:** It specifies the problem (diagnostic errors in radiology), the mechanism (embedded in existing workflow), the trade-off (workflow integration over benchmark accuracy), and why (adoption depends on workflow fit).

### Example 4: Consumer Subscription Service

**Weak:** "We will delight customers with great content."

**Strong:** "We will invest in exclusive mid-budget content that serves the 35-55 demographic underserved by streaming competitors focused on younger audiences. We will not compete for blockbuster licensed content. We accept a smaller catalog in exchange for higher relevance per title for our target audience."

## Template for Writing and Testing a Guiding Policy

### Step 1: Link to the Diagnosis

Write one sentence connecting the guiding policy to the critical challenge:

> "Given that our critical challenge is [diagnosis], our guiding policy is to [approach]."

### Step 2: State the Policy

The policy should be one to three sentences. It should include:

- **What we will do** (the approach)
- **What we will not do** (the trade-off)
- **Why this approach addresses the diagnosis** (the logic)

### Step 3: Run the Tests

| Test | Question | Pass? |
|------|----------|-------|
| Opposite test | Would a reasonable competitor choose the opposite approach? | |
| Diagnosis link | Does this policy directly address the critical challenge in the diagnosis? | |
| Trade-off clarity | Can you name at least one valuable thing this policy requires you to stop or deprioritize? | |
| Coordination value | Can two different teams read this policy and independently make consistent decisions? | |
| Stability | Will this policy remain valid for at least 12-18 months? | |
| Specificity | Would this policy sound wrong if applied to a different company in your industry? | |

### Step 4: Derive Decision Criteria

List three to five rules that teams can use to apply the guiding policy to daily decisions:

1. When choosing between ___ and ___, choose ___.
2. We invest in ___ even at the cost of ___.
3. We measure success by ___, not by ___.
4. We say no to ___ unless ___.
5. When in doubt, optimize for ___.

### Step 5: Stress-Test with Scenarios

Write three real decisions your team will face in the next quarter. For each one, apply the guiding policy and decision criteria. Does the policy produce a clear answer? If not, the policy needs to be more specific.

| Decision | Policy Applied | Clear Answer? |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| [Real upcoming decision 1] | | |
| [Real upcoming decision 2] | | |
| [Real upcoming decision 3] | | |

A guiding policy earns its value not from the elegance of its phrasing but from the clarity of the choices it makes. If your organization's guiding policy does not make anyone uncomfortable — if it does not require giving up something people care about — it is not doing its job. Strategy without trade-offs is not strategy. It is a hope.
