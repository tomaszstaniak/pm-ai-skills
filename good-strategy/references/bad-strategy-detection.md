# Bad Strategy Detection: Identifying and Fixing Strategic Failure

Bad strategy is not the absence of strategy. It is the active presence of something that looks like strategy but fails to do what strategy must do: identify a critical challenge, choose an approach, and coordinate action. Rumelt argues that bad strategy is disturbingly common and that most people cannot distinguish it from good strategy because they have never been taught what good strategy looks like. This guide provides the tools to detect bad strategy, understand why organizations produce it, and convert it into good strategy.

## Rumelt's Four Hallmarks of Bad Strategy

### 1. Fluff

Fluff uses inflated, abstract language to create the illusion of strategic thinking. It sounds impressive but communicates nothing specific enough to guide action.

**What it sounds like:**

- "We will leverage our core competencies to deliver best-in-class solutions that drive stakeholder value."
- "Our strategy is to be the leading platform for digital transformation through customer-centric innovation."
- "We will create a synergistic ecosystem of products and services that empowers our customers to thrive in the modern economy."

**Why it's bad:** Fluff substitutes vocabulary for thought. Strip away the jargon and ask: what specific challenge are we addressing? What specific actions will we take? What specific trade-offs are we making? If the answer to all three is unclear, you have fluff.

**Detection techniques:**

| Technique | How to Apply |
|-----------|--------------|
| **The jargon strip test** | Remove every buzzword (leverage, synergy, best-in-class, ecosystem, empower, transform). Does the remaining sentence say anything specific? |
| **The company swap test** | Replace your company name with a competitor's. Does the statement still apply? If yes, it is not strategy — it is generic aspiration. |
| **The action test** | Can a team member read this statement and know what to do differently tomorrow? If not, it is fluff. |
| **The so-what test** | After reading the statement, ask "so what?" If the answer is "nothing specific changes," it is fluff. |

**Real-world fluff example:** A mid-size technology company's strategy document stated: "Our strategy is to harness the power of cloud-native technologies and artificial intelligence to reimagine the customer journey and establish market leadership through continuous innovation." This statement could apply to thousands of companies. It names no specific challenge, makes no trade-off, and suggests no particular action. It is a paragraph-shaped void.

**The same company, defluffed:** "Our critical challenge is that our on-premise architecture makes it impossible to iterate faster than once per quarter, while cloud-native competitors ship weekly. Our guiding policy is to migrate our core product to a cloud-native architecture within 18 months, accepting feature-freeze on non-essential capabilities during the migration. We compete on deployment speed, not feature breadth."

### 2. Failure to Face the Challenge

A strategy that does not define the challenge it addresses is not a strategy. This hallmark appears when organizations skip the diagnosis entirely and jump to goals, initiatives, or guiding policies without ever articulating what problem they are solving.

**What it looks like:**

- A strategic plan that lists five "pillars" without explaining what threat or opportunity prompted them
- A leadership presentation that opens with market size and revenue targets but never addresses why growth has stalled
- A product strategy that lists features to build without explaining what customer problem they solve or what competitive dynamic they address

**Why it's bad:** Without a defined challenge, there is no basis for choosing one set of actions over another. Any initiative can claim to be "strategic" because there is no test for relevance. Resources scatter across well-intentioned but uncoordinated efforts.

**Detection technique:** Read the strategy document and highlight every sentence that describes a problem, obstacle, or challenge. If you highlight fewer than 10% of the sentences, the strategy is not facing the challenge. If you highlight zero sentences, there is no strategy — there is only a plan.

**The forcing question:** Ask leadership: "What is the single most important obstacle to our success?" If the answer is not clearly reflected in the strategy, the strategy is not facing the challenge.

### 3. Mistaking Goals for Strategy

This is the most common form of bad strategy. The organization states what it wants to achieve (revenue targets, market share, growth rates) and calls that a strategy. Goals are not strategy. Strategy is the method for achieving goals given the constraints of reality.

**What it looks like:**

- "Our strategy is to grow revenue by 40% next year."
- "Our strategy is to become the market leader in our category."
- "Our strategy is to achieve 90% customer satisfaction."

**Why it's bad:** A goal without a method for achieving it is a wish. Telling people to try harder is not strategy. If the organization could achieve 40% growth simply by wanting it, the goal would already have been achieved.

**Detection technique — the "how" test:** After every strategic statement, ask "how?" If the answer is another goal or a restatement of the same goal, you have mistaken goals for strategy.

| Statement | "How?" | Verdict |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| "Grow revenue 40%" | "By acquiring more customers" | Goal, not strategy (another goal) |
| "Acquire more customers" | "Through better marketing" | Still a goal (how will marketing be better?) |
| "Focus all marketing spend on the developer audience via technical content, because developers are the decision-makers in our market and our product wins when it's evaluated technically" | — | This is a guiding policy with a diagnosis embedded. This is strategy. |

**The performance gap trap:** Many organizations define their strategy as "close the gap between current performance and target performance." This is not a strategy. It is arithmetic. The strategy must explain how the gap will be closed, what obstacles prevent it from closing naturally, and why the chosen approach will work.

### 4. Bad Strategic Objectives

Bad strategic objectives are either too vague to guide action, too numerous to focus effort, or internally contradictory.

**Characteristics of bad objectives:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Dog's dinner** | A long list of objectives that tries to accommodate every stakeholder's request | "Our strategic objectives are: grow revenue, improve margins, expand internationally, launch three new products, improve employee satisfaction, upgrade our technology stack, and strengthen our brand." |
| **Blue sky** | Objectives disconnected from the current reality or available resources | "Achieve 50% market share within 12 months" (current share: 2%) |
| **Conflicting** | Objectives that work against each other | "Maximize growth" and "maximize profitability" when the business requires investment to grow |
| **Impractical** | Objectives that sound good but have no feasible implementation path | "Become the most innovative company in our industry" without defining what innovation means, how it's measured, or what resources are devoted to it |

**The feasibility test:** For each objective, ask: "Can I describe in concrete terms the first three steps to achieve this? Do we have the resources to take those steps?" If not, the objective is aspirational, not strategic.

**Good strategic objectives** are:

- **Few:** Three at most. Ideally one primary objective with two supporting objectives.
- **Feasible:** Achievable with available resources, even if difficult.
- **Connected:** Each objective supports the guiding policy and addresses the diagnosis.
- **Proximate:** Close enough to be actionable. "Improve our deployment pipeline to ship daily" is proximate. "Become the industry standard" is not.

## How to Convert Bad Strategy Into Good Strategy

### Step 1: Extract the Hidden Diagnosis

Even bad strategy documents contain clues about what the organization believes its challenges are. Read the document looking for implied threats, opportunities, or obstacles. These are often buried in context-setting paragraphs or slide deck appendices.

Write the implied diagnosis explicitly: "The challenge this strategy seems to be addressing is ___."

### Step 2: Confront Reality

Compare the implied diagnosis against observable evidence:

- Is this the actual most important challenge?
- What evidence supports this diagnosis?
- What evidence contradicts it?
- What challenges is the strategy ignoring?

If the implied diagnosis is wrong or incomplete, write a new diagnosis using the techniques in the Strategic Diagnosis guide.

### Step 3: Apply the Opposite Test

Take each strategic statement and test whether its opposite is also plausible. If not, the statement is not making a real choice. Replace it with a version that does make a choice.

### Step 4: Reduce to One Page

Force the entire strategy onto a single page with three sections:

1. **Diagnosis** (one paragraph): What is the critical challenge?
2. **Guiding Policy** (one paragraph): What is our approach to the challenge, and what do we choose not to do?
3. **Coherent Actions** (bullet list): What specific actions implement the guiding policy?

If the strategy cannot be compressed to one page, it is probably a collection of initiatives rather than a coherent strategy.

### Step 5: Test for Coherence

Do the coherent actions support the guiding policy? Does the guiding policy address the diagnosis? If you removed one action, would the others still make sense? These questions reveal whether the strategy is a system or a list.

## The Strategy Audit Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate any strategy document, presentation, or plan.

| # | Question | Yes | No |
|---|----------|-----|-----|
| 1 | Does the strategy identify a specific, non-obvious challenge? | | |
| 2 | Is the challenge grounded in evidence, not assumption? | | |
| 3 | Does the guiding policy directly address the identified challenge? | | |
| 4 | Does the guiding policy pass the opposite test? | | |
| 5 | Does the guiding policy explicitly state what the organization will not do? | | |
| 6 | Are the strategic objectives few enough to actually focus effort (three or fewer)? | | |
| 7 | Are the objectives feasible with available resources? | | |
| 8 | Do the actions reinforce each other? | | |
| 9 | Does resource allocation match stated priorities? | | |
| 10 | Can a team member read the strategy and make a decision without asking a manager? | | |
| 11 | Is the strategy free of jargon and fluff? | | |
| 12 | Would this strategy fail the company swap test? (It should — if it could belong to any company, it's too generic.) | | |

**Scoring:**
- 10-12 "Yes": Strong strategy. Focus on execution.
- 7-9 "Yes": Decent foundation but gaps that will cause confusion. Address the "No" items.
- 4-6 "Yes": Weak strategy that will not effectively guide the organization. Significant rework needed.
- 0-3 "Yes": This is not a strategy. Start over with a diagnosis.

## Organizational Dynamics That Produce Bad Strategy

Understanding why bad strategy is so common helps you fight it. Bad strategy is usually not the result of stupidity. It is the result of organizational dynamics that reward the appearance of strategy over its substance.

### 1. The Avoidance Dynamic

Facing a genuine strategic challenge means acknowledging that something is wrong, that current approaches are not working, or that painful changes are needed. Many leaders prefer to skip the diagnosis and jump to optimistic goals because the diagnosis would require admitting uncomfortable truths.

**How to counter it:** Create a safe space for honest diagnosis. Frame it as "understanding reality" rather than "assigning blame." Use data to depersonalize the diagnosis. Present the cost of avoidance: the strategy that avoids the real challenge will fail, and failure is more painful than honest diagnosis.

### 2. The Consensus Dynamic

Strategy requires choices, and choices create winners and losers within the organization. A strategy that focuses on the enterprise market means the team working on SMB gets deprioritized. Rather than make this choice and face internal conflict, leaders often create strategies that include something for everyone. The result is a strategy that tries to do everything and therefore does nothing well.

**How to counter it:** Acknowledge the political cost explicitly. Frame the choice not as "your team loses" but as "we concentrate our forces where we can win." Use the diagnosis to make the case: "Given what we've learned about our critical challenge, focusing here is not a preference — it is a necessity." Set clear expectations that deprioritization is not punishment; it is strategic discipline.

### 3. The Template Dynamic

Many organizations follow a strategy-planning process that produces strategy-shaped documents without producing actual strategy. Fill in the mission, vision, values, goals, and objectives templates, and you have a document that looks like strategy but functions as bureaucratic ritual.

**How to counter it:** Replace templates with questions. Instead of "fill in the vision statement," ask "what is the most important obstacle to our success?" Instead of "list five strategic objectives," ask "what specific trade-off will we make?" The quality of strategy depends on the quality of questions, not the quality of templates.

### 4. The Sunk-Cost Dynamic

Organizations accumulate initiatives over time. Each initiative has stakeholders, budgets, and political support. Bad strategy often results from the unwillingness to stop doing things that no longer serve the strategic direction. The result is a growing list of "strategic priorities" that represents the accumulation of past decisions rather than a coherent response to the current situation.

**How to counter it:** Conduct a zero-based strategy review. Instead of asking "should we continue this initiative?" ask "if we were starting from scratch, would we start this initiative?" Apply the coherence test: does this initiative reinforce our guiding policy and our other actions?

### 5. The Aspiration Dynamic

Ambitious leaders often confuse aspiration with strategy. "We will be the number one player in our market" feels like a strategy because it is bold and specific. But it is a destination, not a route. Bad strategy often emerges when leaders assume that setting sufficiently ambitious goals will cause the organization to find a way to achieve them.

**How to counter it:** For every aspirational goal, demand the mechanism. "How will we become number one? What specific advantage will we exploit? What specific trade-off will we make? What will we do differently from the current number one?" If the answers are vague, the aspiration is not yet a strategy.

## How to Push Back on Bad Strategy as a Product Leader

Challenging a bad strategy is politically difficult but professionally necessary. Here are approaches that work.

### Ask Clarifying Questions

Instead of saying "this is bad strategy," ask questions that expose the gaps:

- "What is the specific challenge this strategy addresses?"
- "If we had to choose between Initiative A and Initiative B, which would we pick?"
- "What will we stop doing to free resources for this?"
- "How will a team lead use this strategy to make a daily decision?"
- "What would we see in six months if this strategy is working?"

These questions are non-threatening but force specificity. If the strategy is bad, the inability to answer these questions will make that visible to everyone in the room.

### Propose an Alternative Frame

Rather than criticizing the existing strategy, offer an alternative diagnosis: "I'd like to propose a different way to think about our situation. What if the core challenge is not X but Y?" Then walk through the implications. This shifts the conversation from defending the existing strategy to evaluating two competing diagnoses — a much more productive discussion.

### Use the One-Page Test

Offer to help "sharpen" the strategy by compressing it to one page. This is a constructive, non-confrontational way to reveal the gaps. The act of compression forces choices that the longer document avoided.

### Ground Arguments in Evidence

Bad strategy often survives because it sounds plausible. Counter it with specific data: customer research, win/loss analysis, cohort metrics, competitive benchmarks. When the data contradicts the diagnosis, say: "Here is what the data shows. How does this change our diagnosis?"

### Build Allies Before the Meeting

If you plan to challenge a strategy in a group setting, talk to key stakeholders beforehand. Share your concerns, ask for their perspective, and build a coalition. A lone voice is easily dismissed. Multiple voices asking the same clarifying questions are much harder to ignore.

Bad strategy persists because it is easy, comfortable, and politically safe. Good strategy is hard because it requires admitting uncomfortable truths, making painful trade-offs, and concentrating resources in ways that leave some areas unsupported. The willingness to face this discomfort is what separates organizations that execute effectively from those that produce impressive documents and mediocre results.
