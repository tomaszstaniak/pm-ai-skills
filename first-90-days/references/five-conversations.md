# The Five Conversations with Your Boss

Your relationship with your boss is the single most important relationship in your transition. It is also the one most leaders neglect, because they assume alignment exists when it does not. Michael Watkins' framework of five structured conversations ensures that you and your boss build a shared understanding across the dimensions that matter most.

The five conversations are:

1. **Situational diagnosis** — Agreeing on the state of the business
2. **Expectations** — Aligning on what success looks like
3. **Resources** — Negotiating what you need to succeed
4. **Style** — Understanding how to work together effectively
5. **Personal development** — Identifying where you need to grow

These are not five separate meetings. They are five topics that you weave into your ongoing conversations with your boss during the first 90 days. Some topics arise naturally in a single conversation. Others require dedicated time. This guide helps you prepare for, navigate, and follow up on each one.

## Conversation 1: Situational Diagnosis

### Purpose

Ensure that you and your boss agree on the nature of the challenge you face. If your boss thinks you are in a turnaround and you think you are in a realignment, you will be working at cross-purposes from day one.

### When to Have It

Days 1-7. This should be one of your first substantive conversations. It sets the context for everything else.

### How to Prepare

Before the conversation:
- Complete your initial STARS assessment (even if preliminary)
- Review any materials your boss has shared about the role or team
- List the 3-5 biggest challenges you have identified so far
- Prepare a hypothesis about the situation, but hold it loosely

### Script and Questions

**Opening:** "I want to make sure we are aligned on the situation I am walking into. Based on my first few days, here is what I am seeing. I would love your perspective."

**Questions to ask:**

1. "How would you describe the current state of this team/business? What is the headline?"
2. "When you decided to fill this role, what was the primary problem you were trying to solve?"
3. "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is the situation? Where does this rank among your priorities?"
4. "What does the rest of the leadership team think about the state of this team? Is there alignment, or do people see it differently?"
5. "What has been tried before to address the challenges? What worked and what did not?"
6. "Are there any external factors — market shifts, competitor moves, regulatory changes — that I should be factoring into my diagnosis?"
7. "Is there anything about the situation that I would not learn from talking to the team — something only you can tell me?"

**Closing:** "Based on this conversation, here is how I would characterize the situation: [your summary]. Does that match your view? If not, where do we see it differently?"

### What to Listen For

- Does your boss have a clear view of the situation, or is it fuzzy?
- Does your boss's view match what the team is telling you?
- Is your boss's assessment more optimistic or pessimistic than yours?
- Are there political dynamics that your boss is hinting at but not stating directly?

### Common Pitfall

Your boss describes the situation in one way, but everyone else describes it differently. This means either your boss is out of touch or the team is not being honest with your boss. Either way, it is critical information. Do not ignore the gap — explore it carefully.

## Conversation 2: Expectations

### Purpose

Align on what success looks like — at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and beyond. This is the conversation that prevents the worst transition failure mode: you deliver results that your boss does not value, while neglecting the outcomes your boss actually cares about.

### When to Have It

Days 3-10 for the first pass. Revisit at day 30 and day 60 as your understanding deepens.

### How to Prepare

Before the conversation:
- Write down what you think success looks like at 30, 60, and 90 days
- Identify the metrics you believe are most important
- Prepare to negotiate if your boss's expectations are unrealistic (see section below)

### Script and Questions

**Opening:** "I want to make sure we define success the same way. Can we talk about what you expect from me at 30, 60, and 90 days?"

**Questions to ask:**

1. "What are the three most important things you want me to accomplish in the first 90 days?"
2. "If I could only deliver one thing in 90 days, what would it be?"
3. "How will you evaluate whether I am succeeding? What metrics or indicators will you look at?"
4. "Are there any outcomes that are must-haves versus nice-to-haves?"
5. "What would 'exceeding expectations' look like? What would 'falling short' look like?"
6. "Are there any expectations from the broader leadership team that I should know about?"
7. "What should I explicitly not spend time on, even if it seems important?"
8. "How often should I update you on progress, and in what format?"

**Closing:** "Let me summarize what I heard. My top priorities are [X, Y, Z], with [X] being the non-negotiable. I will update you [frequency] via [format]. Does that sound right?"

### What to Listen For

- How specific are the expectations? Vague expectations ("just make it better") are dangerous because they cannot be met.
- Are the expectations realistic given the resources and timeline?
- Is your boss distinguishing between outcomes (what you deliver) and behaviors (how you lead)?
- Are there unstated expectations? (These often surface as disappointment later.)

### After the Conversation

Send a written summary of what you agreed on. This is not bureaucratic — it is protective. If expectations shift later, you have a reference point.

```
EXPECTATIONS ALIGNMENT SUMMARY
Date: [Date]
Agreed between: [Your name] and [Boss name]

90-DAY PRIORITIES (in order)
1. [Priority] — Success metric: [Metric]
2. [Priority] — Success metric: [Metric]
3. [Priority] — Success metric: [Metric]

30-DAY CHECKPOINT
Expected progress: [Description]

60-DAY CHECKPOINT
Expected progress: [Description]

UPDATE CADENCE
Frequency: [Weekly / Biweekly]
Format: [Meeting / Email / Document]

EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE
- [Thing I will not focus on]
- [Thing I will not focus on]
```

## Conversation 3: Resources

### Purpose

Negotiate for the people, budget, tools, and executive support you need to deliver on the expectations you just aligned on. This conversation links expectations to resources — you cannot be held accountable for outcomes without the means to achieve them.

### When to Have It

Days 14-30 for the initial conversation. Revisit at day 45-60 with evidence from your early wins.

### How to Prepare

Before the conversation:
- List every resource you believe you need
- Prioritize the list: must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
- For each resource, prepare a clear rationale tied to the agreed expectations
- Anticipate objections and prepare responses
- Identify what you can offer in return (commitments, timeline, visibility)

### Script and Questions

**Opening:** "We aligned on [expectations]. I want to discuss what I need to deliver on those commitments. I have done my homework and have a prioritized list."

**Questions to ask (and statements to make):**

1. "To deliver [priority 1], I need [specific resource]. Here is why: [rationale]."
2. "What is the budget and headcount envelope I am working within? Are there hard constraints I should know about?"
3. "Are there resources that other leaders have that I could borrow, share, or reallocate?"
4. "If I cannot get [resource], which of our agreed priorities should I deprioritize?"
5. "I am willing to commit to [specific outcome] by [date] if I can get [resource]. Is that a trade you would make?"
6. "What would I need to demonstrate to earn additional resources in the next quarter?"

**Closing:** "Let me confirm what we agreed: I will get [resources]. In return, I commit to [outcomes by date]. I will not get [resource X] now, but I can revisit at [date] if I demonstrate [condition]."

### Negotiation Tips

**Link resources to expectations explicitly.** Never let your boss hold you to expectations while withholding the resources needed to meet them. If resources are cut, expectations must be adjusted. This is not pushback — it is responsible management.

**Time your ask.** The best time to ask for resources is right after an early win. You have demonstrated results, and your credibility is at a peak. Use that moment.

**Do not ask for everything at once.** Sequence your requests. Get the most critical resource first, deliver a result, then come back for the next one.

**Accept constraints gracefully.** If your boss cannot give you what you need, do not sulk. Ask: "Given this constraint, what do you recommend I prioritize?" This shows maturity and keeps the relationship strong.

## Conversation 4: Style

### Purpose

Understand how your boss likes to work and communicate, and share your own preferences. Style mismatches are a leading cause of transition failure — not because of disagreement on substance, but because of friction in the working relationship.

### When to Have It

Days 7-21. Some of this happens naturally through observation. But a direct conversation accelerates alignment.

### Script and Questions

**Opening:** "I want to make sure we work together as effectively as possible. I have some questions about your working style and preferences, and I am happy to share mine."

**Questions to ask:**

1. "How do you prefer to receive updates — in person, by email, by document, or in a meeting?"
2. "How much detail do you want? Do you prefer a summary with the ability to drill down, or do you want the full picture upfront?"
3. "How do you like to make decisions — do you want to be involved early in the process, or do you prefer I bring you a recommendation?"
4. "What is the best way to raise a problem or risk with you? Do you want to hear about problems immediately, or do you prefer I bring the problem with a proposed solution?"
5. "How do you handle disagreements? If I think we should go a different direction on something, what is the best way to raise that?"
6. "Are there any pet peeves or communication patterns that frustrate you?"
7. "What was the working relationship like with my predecessor? What worked well and what did not?"
8. "How much autonomy do I have in making decisions about my team (hiring, restructuring, process changes)?"

**Share your style too:**

- "I tend to [your communication preference]. Would that work for you?"
- "I am at my best when I have [level of autonomy / frequency of check-ins]."
- "When I disagree, I tend to [your approach]. Is that comfortable for you?"

### Common Style Dimensions

| Dimension | Spectrum | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Communication depth | Headlines only vs. full detail | If you give your boss too much detail, they tune out. Too little, and they feel out of the loop. |
| Decision involvement | Delegate and check vs. involve me early | If you make decisions your boss wanted to weigh in on, they feel blindsided. |
| Problem escalation | Tell me immediately vs. bring solutions | Some bosses want to hear about fires fast. Others want you to handle it and brief them later. |
| Meeting style | Structured agenda vs. free-flowing | Mismatch here creates frustration in every interaction. |
| Feedback delivery | Direct and immediate vs. private and considered | If you give your boss feedback in a way that feels uncomfortable, they will shut down. |
| Written vs. verbal | Reads documents vs. prefers conversation | If you send a 5-page document to a boss who prefers a hallway conversation, the document will not be read. |

### What to Listen For

- Your boss's style may differ from what they say their style is. Observe the gap between stated and revealed preferences.
- If your boss says "I like to delegate" but then micromanages, they are telling you something about their trust level with you (not yet high) rather than their actual style.
- Adapt to your boss's style, especially early in the relationship. You can negotiate changes later once trust is established.

## Conversation 5: Personal Development

### Purpose

Identify the areas where you need to grow to succeed in this role, and get your boss's input and support. This conversation signals self-awareness and maturity. It also gives your boss an opportunity to share concerns in a constructive frame.

### When to Have It

Days 30-45. You need enough experience in the role to have a realistic view of your gaps.

### How to Prepare

Before the conversation:
- Reflect on what has been hardest in the first month
- Identify 2-3 areas where you feel least confident
- Think about feedback you have received from others
- Consider the skills the role will require in 6-12 months that you may not have today

### Script and Questions

**Opening:** "I want to be intentional about my development in this role. I have some thoughts on where I need to grow, and I would value your perspective."

**Questions to ask:**

1. "Based on what you have seen so far, what do you think are my biggest strengths in this role?"
2. "Where do you see the biggest gaps between what the role requires and what I bring today?"
3. "What is the skill or capability that, if I developed it, would make the biggest difference?"
4. "Are there specific experiences, assignments, or relationships that would help me grow?"
5. "Is there anyone in the organization you think I should learn from?"
6. "How will I know if I am developing in the right areas? What will you look for?"

**Share your self-assessment:**

- "I think my biggest development area is [X]. Here is what I am doing about it: [plan]."
- "I am looking for [type of support — coaching, feedback, exposure]. Is that something you can provide?"

### Personal Development Plan

After the conversation, document a simple plan:

```
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Date: [Date]

STRENGTHS TO LEVERAGE
1. [Strength] — How I will use it: [Application]
2. [Strength] — How I will use it: [Application]

DEVELOPMENT AREAS
1. [Area] — Why it matters: [Impact on role]
   Action: [What I will do]
   Support needed: [From whom]
   Milestone: [How I will know I am improving]
   Timeline: [Date]

2. [Area] — Why it matters: [Impact on role]
   Action: [What I will do]
   Support needed: [From whom]
   Milestone: [How I will know I am improving]
   Timeline: [Date]
```

## Adapting for Remote and Hybrid Settings

When you and your boss are not co-located, the five conversations require more deliberate effort.

### Challenges of Remote Transitions

- You lose informal interaction. No hallway conversations, no lunch, no reading body language in meetings.
- Communication lag. Async communication creates gaps where misalignment can grow unnoticed.
- Relationship building is slower. Trust takes longer to develop without in-person interaction.
- Style mismatches are amplified. A boss who prefers verbal communication will find it harder to work with a remote direct report who defaults to written updates.

### Adaptations

| Conversation | In-Person Approach | Remote Adaptation |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Situational diagnosis | Single long conversation | Break into two shorter video calls. Send a pre-read with your initial observations. |
| Expectations | Whiteboard session | Shared document that you both edit. Video call to discuss and align. |
| Resources | Face-to-face negotiation | Video call with a well-prepared written proposal sent in advance. Follow up with a written summary. |
| Style | Natural observation + direct conversation | Ask explicitly. Over-communicate about your own style. Default to video over text for the first month. |
| Personal development | Informal, coffee-style conversation | Schedule a dedicated 30-minute video call. Send a self-assessment in advance so the conversation is focused. |

### Remote-Specific Tips

- **Default to video on** for the first 90 days. You need to build a personal connection before you can go camera-off.
- **Over-communicate.** In remote settings, no one can see you working. Share more frequent updates than you think necessary.
- **Create informal touchpoints.** A weekly 15-minute "no agenda" check-in can replicate some of what you lose without co-location.
- **If possible, meet in person at least once in the first 30 days.** Even a single day of in-person interaction accelerates relationship building significantly.

## When Your Boss Is Unavailable or Disengaged

Some bosses are hard to reach. They may be overcommitted, managing too many direct reports, or simply not invested in your transition. This is more common than you might expect, and it is one of the most dangerous situations for a new leader.

### Signs Your Boss Is Disengaged

- Meetings are repeatedly rescheduled or canceled
- Responses to your updates are delayed or perfunctory
- Your boss does not introduce you to key stakeholders
- You receive little or no feedback in the first 30 days
- Your boss defers to "just do what you think is best" on everything

### What to Do

1. **Do not take it personally.** A disengaged boss is usually overwhelmed, not hostile.
2. **Make it easy for them.** Send short, structured updates that require minimal effort to process. Use a consistent format they can scan in 2 minutes.
3. **Be explicit about what you need.** "I need 30 minutes this week to align on expectations. Can I get on your calendar?" is better than hinting.
4. **Create forcing functions.** Propose a 30-day check-in. Put a specific agenda in writing. Make it hard to defer.
5. **Build lateral support.** If your boss is not available, lean more heavily on peers and your boss's peers. Build a network that compensates for the gap.
6. **Manage up.** If after 30 days your boss is still disengaged, escalate gently: "I want to make sure I am on the right track. I would really value 30 minutes to review my progress and priorities."

### What Not to Do

- Do not proceed without any alignment. Operating in a vacuum is risky.
- Do not go above your boss to their boss. This almost always backfires.
- Do not complain to peers about your boss's unavailability. It will get back to them.

## Handling Unrealistic Expectations

Sometimes your boss's expectations are not achievable given the resources, timeline, or situation. This conversation requires courage and skill.

### How to Push Back Constructively

**Step 1: Acknowledge the goal.** "I understand why [outcome] is important. I am aligned on the direction."

**Step 2: Share what you have learned.** "Based on my assessment, here is what I have found: [evidence]. This changes the picture in these ways: [implications]."

**Step 3: Propose an alternative.** "I believe we can achieve [modified outcome] in [timeline]. To achieve the original target, we would need [additional resources / more time / reduced scope in another area]."

**Step 4: Force a choice.** "Given the constraints, I see three options: (A) deliver [original outcome] but delay by [X weeks], (B) deliver [partial outcome] on the original timeline, or (C) invest [additional resources] to hit both. Which would you prefer?"

**Step 5: Document the agreement.** Whatever you agree on, put it in writing.

### Key Principles

- Never just say "that is not possible." Always propose an alternative.
- Use data, not opinions. "I think this is unrealistic" is weak. "Based on these 12 interviews and this data, the team can deliver X in 90 days, not Y" is strong.
- Make your boss a partner in the solution, not the opponent.
- If your boss insists on unrealistic expectations despite evidence, document your concerns. You may need this record later.

## Follow-Up Cadence

The five conversations are not one-time events. They are ongoing themes that you revisit throughout your transition and beyond.

| Conversation | Initial | Day 30 | Day 60 | Day 90 | Ongoing |
|-------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Situational diagnosis | Days 1-7 | Revisit with new data | Update if STARS assessment has changed | Final assessment | Quarterly |
| Expectations | Days 3-10 | Check-in on 30-day progress | Adjust if needed based on results | Review and set 91-180 day expectations | Monthly |
| Resources | Days 14-30 | Follow up on pending requests | Negotiate with evidence from early wins | Finalize resource plan | Quarterly |
| Style | Days 7-21 | Observe and adjust | Check-in: "How is our working relationship?" | Refine based on experience | As needed |
| Personal development | Days 30-45 | N/A | Check-in on development plan | Assess progress | Quarterly |

### The Meta-Conversation

At day 90, have a direct conversation about the relationship itself: "How is this working? What should I do more of? Less of? Differently?" This takes courage, but it is one of the highest-leverage conversations you can have. The feedback you receive at day 90 will shape your effectiveness for the next year.

Most leaders never ask this question. The ones who do are the ones who build the strongest boss relationships — because they signal that they are invested in the relationship, not just the results.
