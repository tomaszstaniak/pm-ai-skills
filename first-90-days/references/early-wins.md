# Securing Early Wins

Early wins are the currency of leadership transitions. They build your credibility, energize your team, and create momentum that makes everything else easier. But the wrong kind of early win — too ambitious, too trivial, or aimed at the wrong audience — can damage your transition more than no win at all.

This guide covers how to identify, sequence, execute, and track early wins in the first 90 days.

## Win Identification Criteria

Not every accomplishment qualifies as a strategic early win. A true early win meets all five of these criteria.

### The Five Criteria

**1. Visible** — The win must be seen by the people who matter. A backend optimization that improves performance by 15% is great work, but if no one outside your team notices, it does not build credibility. Visibility does not mean self-promotion — it means choosing work that naturally reaches your key stakeholders.

**2. Achievable within 30-60 days** — If it takes longer than 60 days, it is not an early win. It is a project. Early wins must land within the window when people are forming their first impression of you. Anything that requires more than 60 days of effort should be broken into milestones, and the first milestone should be your early win.

**3. Directionally correct** — The win must align with your long-term strategy. It should not be a detour — it should be the first step on the path you intend to walk. If your strategy is to improve customer retention, your early win should be related to customer retention, not to internal process improvement.

**4. Meaningful, not cosmetic** — A genuine early win solves a real problem or delivers real value. Rebranding the team Slack channel is not an early win. Fixing the onboarding process that has been causing 30% of new users to drop off is.

**5. Builds capability, not just results** — The best early wins do double duty. They deliver a result and they build a muscle. If your early win involves cross-functional collaboration, you have not just delivered a result — you have established a pattern of collaboration that will serve you in future projects.

### Quick Test

For any candidate early win, score it against these five criteria:

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Visible to key stakeholders | | |
| Achievable in 30-60 days | | |
| Aligned with long-term direction | | |
| Solves a real problem | | |
| Builds a useful capability | | |
| **Total** | **/25** | |

Pursue wins that score 20 or higher. Anything below 15 is not worth the investment.

## Sequencing Wins for Maximum Impact

The order in which you pursue wins matters as much as which wins you choose.

### Phase 1: Low-Hanging Fruit (Days 15-30)

**What to target:** Small, visible improvements that require minimal political capital. These signal competence and attention to detail.

Examples:
- Fix a broken process that everyone complains about
- Remove a bottleneck that has been slowing the team down
- Deliver a quick improvement to a customer-facing metric
- Resolve a long-standing minor issue that the previous leader ignored

**Why start here:** You have not yet earned the right to make big moves. Small wins build the credibility you need for bigger wins later. They also signal that you listen — that you heard the team's pain points during your learning phase and acted on them.

### Phase 2: Collaborative Wins (Days 30-50)

**What to target:** Wins that require working across teams or functions. These demonstrate that you can get things done in the organization's ecosystem, not just within your own team.

Examples:
- Partner with another team to solve a shared problem
- Broker an agreement between two groups that have been misaligned
- Deliver a cross-functional initiative that has been stuck

**Why sequence these second:** You need the credibility from Phase 1 before peers will invest in collaborating with you. And you need the relationships from your learning phase before you can identify the right collaborative opportunities.

### Phase 3: Strategic Wins (Days 50-75)

**What to target:** Wins that are directly tied to your strategic vision. These signal where you intend to take the team and demonstrate that your strategy produces results.

Examples:
- Launch the first version of a new initiative
- Hit a metric that demonstrates your strategic direction is working
- Secure resources or headcount based on your strategic case

**Why sequence these last:** Strategic wins require the most political capital, the most organizational buy-in, and the most execution muscle. You need the credibility and relationships built in Phases 1 and 2 to pull them off.

### Sequencing Rules

1. **Never start with a strategic win.** You will not have enough credibility or understanding to execute it well.
2. **Never stop at low-hanging fruit.** If all your early wins are small fixes, people will wonder whether you have a bigger vision.
3. **Each win should set up the next.** Phase 1 wins build credibility for Phase 2. Phase 2 wins build relationships for Phase 3.
4. **Aim for one win per phase.** Three well-executed wins in 75 days is better than seven mediocre ones.

## Coalition Building Tactics

Every early win requires support from others. The difference between leaders who build momentum and leaders who stall out is how effectively they build coalitions.

### Mapping the Landscape

For any initiative, the people around you fall into five groups:

| Group | Description | Your Strategy |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Champions** | Actively support your initiative. Will spend political capital on it. | Engage early. Give them ownership. Make them look good. |
| **Supporters** | Agree with your direction but will not stick their necks out. | Keep them informed. Make it easy for them to support you publicly. |
| **Fence-sitters** | Could go either way. Watching to see who wins. | Invest the most time here. Understand their concerns. Address them directly. |
| **Skeptics** | Have concerns but are persuadable. Their objections may be legitimate. | Listen to them carefully. Incorporate their feedback where valid. Convert them into supporters by showing respect for their perspective. |
| **Opponents** | Will actively work against your initiative. | Understand their motivation. Limit their ability to block you. Do not try to convert them — work around them. |

### Time Allocation Rule

Most leaders make the mistake of spending too much time with champions and supporters (because it feels good) and too little time with fence-sitters and skeptics (because it is uncomfortable). Flip this:

- Champions: 10% of your coalition-building time
- Supporters: 15%
- Fence-sitters: 40%
- Skeptics: 25%
- Opponents: 10%

### Tactics for Each Group

**Converting fence-sitters:**
- Ask them: "What would you need to see to feel confident about this?"
- Give them a role in the initiative so they have a stake in its success
- Share early results with them before you share broadly
- Never pressure them — let the evidence do the convincing

**Engaging skeptics:**
- Ask them: "What am I missing? What concerns you about this approach?"
- Thank them publicly for raising tough questions
- Incorporate their feedback where it improves the plan (and credit them)
- If they have a valid concern, address it before proceeding

**Managing opponents:**
- Understand whether their opposition is personal, political, or substantive
- If substantive, treat them like skeptics — address the concern
- If political, ensure your boss and sponsors are aligned with you
- Do not engage in public battles. Win through results, not arguments.
- Document decisions and rationale so opponents cannot rewrite history later

## Genuine Wins vs. Manufactured Wins

There is a critical difference between a genuine early win and a manufactured one, and experienced organizations can tell the difference instantly.

### Genuine Early Win

- Solves a problem that existed before you arrived
- The team and stakeholders independently acknowledge the improvement
- The benefit is measurable or observable
- It required real effort and judgment, not just authority
- It can be sustained after the initial push

### Manufactured Win

- You created a problem so you could solve it
- Only you and your boss think it is a win
- The benefit is theoretical or requires creative metric interpretation
- It was accomplished by pulling rank or spending political capital you had not earned
- It reverts as soon as you stop paying attention

**The test:** If you left tomorrow, would the win still be considered a win? If yes, it is genuine. If people would undo it, it was manufactured.

### Why Manufactured Wins Backfire

- Teams see through them immediately. Your credibility drops.
- They signal that you prioritize optics over substance.
- They waste organizational energy on your reputation instead of real problems.
- They create cynicism that makes future genuine wins harder to achieve.

## Common Early-Win Traps

| Trap | What It Looks Like | Why It Fails | Better Alternative |
|------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Too ambitious** | "I will reorganize the entire team in my first month" | You do not have enough context. The org is not ready. People resist. | Start with a smaller, scoped initiative that demonstrates the same principle. |
| **Too trivial** | "I fixed the team wiki and reorganized the shared drive" | It does not register as leadership. No one cares. | Fix something that affects how the team delivers results, not how files are organized. |
| **Wrong audience** | You deliver a win that impresses your boss but alienates your team | The team feels used as props for your career advancement | Choose wins that benefit the team directly. Boss credibility follows. |
| **Creates enemies** | You "win" by overruling a peer or taking credit for shared work | You gain one win but lose multiple allies | Share credit generously. Frame wins as "we" not "I." |
| **Solves yesterday's problem** | You fix the issue that got the previous leader fired | The organization has already moved on. New challenges are emerging. | Focus on current and future challenges, not historical ones. |
| **Depends on heroics** | You personally work 80-hour weeks to deliver a result | It is not sustainable and it sets a bad precedent for the team | Choose wins that demonstrate good process, not personal heroism. |
| **Ignores the STARS context** | You pursue a quick win in a sustaining-success context where patience is needed | You signal that you do not understand or respect the current state | Match your early-win strategy to your STARS situation. |

### Tracking Cadence

- Review your early-win plan weekly with yourself
- Update your boss biweekly on progress
- At day 45, assess whether your wins are landing as intended — if not, adjust
- At day 75, do a full retrospective: What worked? What did you learn? How did the wins affect your credibility?

## Early Wins by STARS Situation

Your STARS diagnosis should directly inform your early-win strategy.

| STARS Situation | Best Early-Win Strategy | Example |
|----------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Start-up** | Ship something. Anything tangible that demonstrates progress. | Launch an MVP, hire the first key team member, deliver a prototype to stakeholders. |
| **Turnaround** | Stop the bleeding. Fix the most visible, most urgent problem. | Cut a failing product line, resolve the top customer complaint, close a talent gap. |
| **Accelerated Growth** | Remove a bottleneck. Show that you understand what is breaking under scale. | Automate a manual process, hire for the most critical gap, fix the process that is causing delays. |
| **Realignment** | Build the case for change. Your "win" is getting people to see the problem. | Present a competitive analysis, run a customer survey, facilitate a strategic offsite. |
| **Sustaining Success** | Make a targeted improvement that builds on existing strengths. | Improve a key metric by 5-10%, introduce a new capability that extends a current strength, develop a team member. |

## The Compounding Effect

Early wins are not isolated events. Each win changes the environment for the next one. Your first win buys you credibility. Your second win buys you trust. Your third win buys you the right to propose bigger changes.

Think of early wins as compound interest. The goal is not to maximize any single win — it is to create a sequence of wins that builds unstoppable momentum. By day 75, if you have executed three well-chosen wins, you will have the credibility, relationships, and organizational capital to drive your full strategic agenda.

The leaders who fail in transitions are rarely the ones who lack a good strategy. They are the ones who did not build the foundation of credibility and trust required to execute that strategy. Early wins are that foundation.
