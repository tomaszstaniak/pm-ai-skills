# The Learning Phase: Days 1-30

The first 30 days of any leadership transition are a learning investment. Every hour you spend learning in the first month saves you ten hours of rework later. The leaders who fail in transitions are almost always the ones who stopped learning too early — who arrived with a plan and started executing before they understood the terrain.

This guide provides a structured approach to learning in the first 30 days, including templates, interview scripts, and frameworks for synthesizing what you discover.

## Structured Learning Plan Template

### Week 1: Orientation and First Impressions

| Day | Focus | Activities | Output |
|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Logistics and context | Meet your boss. Get systems access. Read the last 3 months of team communications. Review org chart. | First impressions document |
| 2 | Team introduction | Meet each direct report 1:1 (30 min each). Ask the 5 universal questions. | Initial team map |
| 3 | Stakeholder mapping | Identify your top 10 stakeholders. Schedule meetings for weeks 2-3. | Stakeholder list with priorities |
| 4 | Business immersion | Review key metrics, dashboards, recent presentations, and strategy documents. | Questions list for week 2 |
| 5 | Reflection | Write down your initial hypotheses. Note what surprised you. Identify your biggest knowledge gaps. | Week 1 synthesis memo |

### Week 2: Deep Interviews

| Day | Focus | Activities | Output |
|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| 6-7 | Peer conversations | Meet 3-5 peer leaders. Understand cross-functional dynamics. | Peer perspective summary |
| 8-9 | Skip-level conversations | Meet 4-6 people one or two levels below your directs. Listen for themes. | Skip-level themes |
| 10 | Customer/user immersion | Sit in on customer calls, read support tickets, review NPS data. | Customer insight summary |

### Week 3: Pattern Recognition

| Day | Focus | Activities | Output |
|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| 11-12 | Key influencer meetings | Meet 3-4 people who are informal power centers. These are not always senior. | Influence map |
| 13-14 | Process observation | Attend existing team meetings as an observer. Watch how decisions get made. | Process and culture notes |
| 15 | Synthesis | Compare what different groups told you. Look for contradictions and blind spots. | Emerging themes document |

### Week 4: Hypothesis Testing

| Day | Focus | Activities | Output |
|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| 16-17 | Validate hypotheses | Go back to key people with your emerging perspective. Test your assumptions. | Validated/invalidated hypotheses |
| 18-19 | External benchmarking | Talk to industry peers, read analyst reports, review competitive landscape. | External context summary |
| 20 | 30-day synthesis | Write your learning synthesis. Share with your boss. Adjust your 90-day plan. | 30-day learning report |

## The 5 Questions for Every Introductory Meeting

Ask these five questions in every introductory meeting during your first two weeks. The power is in the pattern — hearing 20 different people answer the same questions reveals the real story of the organization.

### The Questions

1. **"What is the biggest challenge facing this team right now?"**
   - Listen for: Whether people agree on the challenge. If they do not, that tells you something important.
   - Follow-up: "How long has this been a challenge? What has been tried?"

2. **"What is working well that I should be careful not to change?"**
   - Listen for: What people are proud of. What they are afraid you will disrupt.
   - Follow-up: "Why does that work well? Who deserves credit?"

3. **"If you were in my role, what would you do in the first 90 days?"**
   - Listen for: What people have been wanting to happen. Where they see opportunity.
   - Follow-up: "What would make that difficult? Who would need to be involved?"

4. **"What do I need to know that I would not learn from reading reports or attending meetings?"**
   - Listen for: The unwritten rules. The political dynamics. The history.
   - Follow-up: "Can you give me a specific example?"

5. **"Who else should I talk to?"**
   - Listen for: Who the real influencers are. Who gets mentioned repeatedly.
   - Follow-up: "What would they add to my understanding?"

### How to Use the Answers

After every meeting, spend 5 minutes recording the answers in a simple table:

| Person | Role | Biggest Challenge | What Works | Their Advice | Hidden Info | Who Else |
|--------|------|-------------------|------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| [Name] | [Role] | [Answer] | [Answer] | [Answer] | [Answer] | [Names] |

After 15-20 conversations, patterns will emerge. The themes that appear in more than half of conversations are your highest-priority areas.

## Stakeholder Interview Scripts

### What to Ask Your Boss

Your boss is the most important relationship to get right. In the first two weeks, have at least two substantive conversations. Here is what to cover.

**First conversation (day 1-3):**

- "What does success look like for me at 30, 60, and 90 days?"
- "What are the two or three things you most want me to focus on?"
- "What should I absolutely not do or change in the first 90 days?"
- "How do you prefer to communicate — email, chat, meetings, or documents?"
- "How often should I update you, and in what format?"
- "What is the one thing the previous person in this role did not do well?"
- "Are there any decisions you have been holding for my arrival?"

**Second conversation (day 7-14):**

- "Based on what I have learned so far, here is what I am seeing. Does this match your perspective?"
- "Are there any stakeholder relationships I should prioritize or be careful with?"
- "What resources can I realistically expect, and what would I need to earn?"
- "What are the biggest risks you see for this team in the next 6 months?"

### What to Ask Peers

Peers are your lateral network. They control resources, information, and access that you need. They are also the group most likely to see you as a competitor.

- "How does your team interact with mine? Where are the handoff points?"
- "Where have there been friction or coordination problems in the past?"
- "What do you need from my team that you are not getting today?"
- "What can I do to make your life easier in the first 90 days?"
- "Who on my team do you work with most, and how is that relationship?"
- "What should I know about how decisions get made around here?"

### What to Ask Direct Reports

Direct reports will be your primary source of ground-truth information. They will also be testing you — watching to see what kind of leader you are.

- "Tell me about your role and what you are working on right now."
- "What are you most proud of in the last 6 months?"
- "What is the biggest obstacle to your team doing great work?"
- "What did the previous leader do well? What would you change?"
- "What is one thing I could do in the first month that would make the biggest difference for you?"
- "How do you prefer to receive feedback?"
- "What should I know about the team dynamics?"

### What to Ask Skip-Level Reports

Skip-levels give you unfiltered perspective on how things actually work, versus how your direct reports say they work.

- "What is it like to work on this team day-to-day?"
- "If you could fix one process or workflow, what would it be?"
- "Do you feel like you have the tools and support you need to do great work?"
- "What do you wish leadership understood better about your work?"
- "What makes someone successful on this team? What makes someone struggle?"

**Important:** Always tell your direct reports before you do skip-level meetings. Frame it as "I want to understand the full picture" not "I am checking up on you."

### What to Ask Key Influencers

Every organization has people whose influence exceeds their title. They may be long-tenured individual contributors, trusted advisors, or people who sit at critical information crossroads.

- "You have been here a long time. What has changed the most?"
- "What has been tried before that did not work, and why?"
- "Who really makes things happen around here?"
- "If I wanted to get something important done quickly, how would you suggest I go about it?"
- "What mistakes have you seen new leaders make?"

## Cultural Assessment Framework

Culture is what people do when no one is watching. It is the most important thing to understand and the hardest to observe directly. Use these seven dimensions as a diagnostic lens.

### Seven Dimensions of Organizational Culture

| Dimension | What to Observe | Questions to Ask | Red Flags |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Decision-making** | Who makes decisions? How fast? How much consensus is required? | "Walk me through how the last big decision was made." | Decisions take weeks. No one knows who decides. |
| **Conflict** | Is disagreement expressed openly or suppressed? How are disputes resolved? | "When people disagree here, what happens?" | "We do not really have conflict" (they do, it is just underground). |
| **Communication** | Formal vs. informal? Written vs. verbal? Top-down vs. bottom-up? | "How do you find out about important changes?" | People learn about changes from rumors, not official channels. |
| **Recognition** | What gets rewarded? Individual or team achievement? Results or effort? | "Who was the last person recognized, and for what?" | Only heroics get recognized. Steady performance is invisible. |
| **Risk tolerance** | How does the organization respond to failure? Is experimentation encouraged? | "Tell me about a project that failed. What happened to the people involved?" | Failure is punished. People only propose safe ideas. |
| **Work-life norms** | What are the real expectations about hours, availability, and boundaries? | "What does a typical week look like for you?" | People say "we value balance" but send emails at midnight. |
| **Meeting culture** | Are meetings productive? Who talks? Are decisions made or just discussed? | Attend 3-5 meetings as a silent observer. | Meetings are status updates with no decisions. Same topics recur. |

### How to Observe Culture

- **Watch the calendar.** What gets scheduled tells you what the organization values.
- **Watch the Slack/email patterns.** When do people send messages? How formal is the tone? Who responds to whom?
- **Watch who gets airtime.** In meetings, who speaks first? Who speaks most? Who gets interrupted?
- **Watch what gets celebrated.** The all-hands meeting topics, the Slack celebrations, the promotion announcements — these reveal the real values.
- **Watch what gets ignored.** What complaints or requests go unanswered? What metrics are never discussed?

## Synthesizing Learning into Actionable Insights

After three weeks of learning, you will have a mountain of notes, impressions, and data. Here is how to turn it into something useful.

### The Synthesis Framework

**Step 1: List your top 10 observations.** Write down the 10 most important things you have learned, in order of importance.

**Step 2: Group them into themes.** Most observations will cluster into 3-5 themes. Common themes include: talent gaps, process inefficiency, strategic misalignment, cultural dysfunction, and resource constraints.

**Step 3: For each theme, answer three questions:**
- What is the root cause? (Not the symptom — the cause.)
- What would "good" look like?
- What would it take to get there?

**Step 4: Prioritize ruthlessly.** You cannot fix everything at once. Pick the 2-3 themes that have the highest leverage — where a small investment of effort produces a disproportionate result.

**Step 5: Write your 30-day learning synthesis.** This is a one-page document that captures your perspective. Share it with your boss.

## Common Learning-Phase Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Consequence | How to Avoid |
|---------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Action imperative** | You feel pressure to "do something" and prove yourself | You make changes before understanding the context, creating enemies and rework | Set a personal rule: no major decisions in the first 2 weeks |
| **Sticking to the familiar** | You gravitate toward the function or domain you know best | You develop a lopsided understanding of the organization | Force yourself to spend 50% of learning time outside your comfort zone |
| **Relying on a single source** | Your boss or one direct report becomes your primary informant | You get a filtered, biased view | Deliberately seek out dissenting voices and people outside the inner circle |
| **Not taking notes** | You think you will remember | Details blur together after 20 conversations | Write notes within 1 hour of every meeting. Use a consistent format. |
| **Asking leading questions** | You arrive with a hypothesis and seek confirmation | You miss the real story | Ask open-ended questions. Let people finish. Do not share your opinion until week 3. |
| **Ignoring the informal network** | You focus on the org chart | You miss the people who actually make things happen | Ask everyone: "Who really knows how things work around here?" |
| **Announcing your plan too early** | You want to show competence and vision | People feel unheard, and you commit to a plan based on incomplete information | Share observations and questions, not conclusions, during the first 30 days |
| **Skipping skip-levels** | You feel it would undermine your direct reports | You only hear the version of reality your directs want you to hear | Normalize skip-levels from day one. Frame them as standard practice. |
| **Neglecting your own well-being** | You overwork to prove yourself | Burnout, poor decisions, damaged relationships | Block recovery time on your calendar. The first 90 days is a marathon, not a sprint. |

## Tracking Your Learning Progress

At the end of each week during the learning phase, answer these four questions:

1. **What did I learn this week that I did not know before?** (List the top 3 insights.)
2. **What surprised me?** (Surprises are signals — they reveal gaps between your assumptions and reality.)
3. **What am I still confused about?** (Confusion is fine in week 1. It is a problem in week 4.)
4. **Who do I still need to talk to?** (Your stakeholder map should be growing, not shrinking.)

The goal of the learning phase is not to gather information for its own sake. It is to build the foundation for smart action. Every conversation, observation, and data point should feed into one question: "What should I do in the next 60 days, and why?"
