# The Acceleration Phase: Days 45-90

The first 30 days are for learning. Days 30-45 are for securing early wins. Days 45-90 are for acceleration — the phase where you shift from proving yourself to building the engine that will drive performance long after the transition is over.

This is where you assess your team, design your operating rhythm, negotiate for resources, and begin making the tough calls that shape your organization's trajectory. This guide covers each of these with practical frameworks and templates.

## Team Assessment Framework

The single most impactful thing you do in your first 90 days is get the right people in the right roles. Every other decision — strategy, process, culture — depends on having a team that can execute.

### The Three Dimensions of Assessment

Evaluate every team member on three dimensions:

**1. Performance** — Are they delivering results in their current role?
- Look at the last 6-12 months of output
- Ask their peers and cross-functional partners, not just their own self-assessment
- Separate individual performance from team or environmental factors

**2. Potential** — Can they grow into what the role will require in 12-18 months?
- Consider learning agility, not just current skill
- Look for evidence of growth in past roles
- Assess whether they are at the ceiling of their capability or still climbing

**3. Fit** — Do they align with the direction you are taking the team?
- Cultural fit: Do their values and working style align with the team you are building?
- Strategic fit: Do their skills match where you are going, not just where you have been?
- Motivation fit: Do they want to do what the role will become?

### Assessment Grid

Plot each team member on this grid:

| | High Performance | Low Performance |
|---|---|---|
| **High Potential** | Stars — invest heavily. Give stretch assignments. These are your future leaders. | Diamonds in the rough — investigate. Are they in the wrong role? Do they need coaching? Have they been mismanaged? |
| **Low Potential** | Solid contributors — value them. Not everyone needs to be a future VP. Clear about expectations and rewards. | Tough call — may need to move or remove. Do not let loyalty delay a necessary decision. |

### Assessment Questions to Ask Yourself

For each team member, answer these honestly:

1. If this person told me they were leaving, how would I feel? (Relieved, neutral, or panicked?)
2. Would I hire this person for this role today, knowing what I know?
3. Is this person making the people around them better or worse?
4. Can this person do the job the role will become in 12 months, not just the job it is today?
5. Does this person take ownership, or do they wait for direction?
6. How do their peers and direct reports describe working with them?

## The Keep, Coach, Move, Remove Framework

Based on your assessment, every team member falls into one of four categories. The key is to be honest with yourself and act with appropriate speed.

### Keep

**Who:** High performers who fit the direction. Your stars and solid contributors.

**Actions:**
- Tell them explicitly that you value them and want them to stay
- Understand what motivates them and invest in it
- Give them visibility and growth opportunities
- Shield them from unnecessary disruption during the transition
- Ask them: "What would make you leave? What keeps you here?"

**Timeline:** Within the first 30 days, have a direct conversation with every person you want to keep. Do not assume they know.

### Coach

**Who:** People with potential who need development. People who are underperforming due to fixable causes (wrong process, unclear expectations, skill gap).

**Actions:**
- Set clear expectations with specific, measurable outcomes
- Provide direct feedback on what needs to change
- Offer support: training, mentorship, tools, or reduced scope
- Set a time-bound checkpoint: 30-45 days to show improvement
- Document the conversation and expectations

**Timeline:** Start coaching conversations by day 45. Set a checkpoint no later than day 75. If there is no improvement by day 75, escalate to "move" or "remove."

### Move

**Who:** People who are capable but misaligned with their current role. They might thrive in a different function, team, or scope.

**Actions:**
- Have an honest conversation: "I think your strengths are better suited to [X]. I would like to explore that."
- Partner with HR and other leaders to identify internal opportunities
- Frame the move as a positive step, not a demotion
- Support the transition actively — do not just shuffle them out

**Timeline:** Identify candidates for moves by day 45. Execute moves by day 75.

### Remove

**Who:** People who cannot or will not meet the bar, and where coaching or moving is not a viable option.

**Actions:**
- Consult HR and legal before taking action
- Be direct, compassionate, and clear in the conversation
- Provide a fair severance and support for their transition
- Communicate the change to the team promptly and honestly (without sharing private details)
- Do not apologize for the decision — but do show empathy for the person

**Timeline:** If you know someone needs to be removed, do not delay beyond day 60. Every week you wait, the team watches you tolerate underperformance. That signals your standards.

### A Note on Timing

The most common mistake new leaders make with team assessment is waiting too long. You do not need perfect information to act. If you are 80% confident someone is in the wrong role, that is enough to start a conversation. The cost of a wrong assessment is lower than the cost of months of inaction.

The second most common mistake is acting too fast. Do not make team changes in the first two weeks. You need at least 30 days of observation, conversation, and data before you can make good calls.

## Operating Rhythm Design

Your operating rhythm — the recurring meetings, reviews, and rituals that structure your team's work — is the heartbeat of execution. A good operating rhythm creates clarity, accountability, and flow. A bad one creates meeting fatigue and confusion.

### Core Rituals to Establish

| Ritual | Frequency | Duration | Purpose | Participants |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Team standup** | Daily or 3x/week | 15 min | Surface blockers. Coordinate. | Direct reports |
| **1:1s with directs** | Weekly | 30-45 min | Coaching, problem-solving, relationship-building | You + each direct report |
| **Team meeting** | Weekly | 60 min | Strategic discussion, cross-team coordination, decision-making | Direct reports |
| **Skip-level 1:1s** | Monthly | 30 min | Unfiltered perspective on the team. Development. | You + selected skip-levels (rotating) |
| **Business review** | Biweekly or monthly | 60-90 min | Review metrics, assess progress against goals, identify risks | Direct reports + key stakeholders |
| **Boss update** | Weekly | 30 min | Alignment, risk escalation, resource requests | You + your boss |
| **Retrospective** | Monthly | 60 min | Continuous improvement. What worked, what did not, what to change. | Direct reports |

### Design Principles for Your Operating Rhythm

1. **Every meeting must have a clear purpose.** If you cannot state the purpose in one sentence, cancel it.
2. **Separate information sharing from decision-making.** Status updates should be async (written). Meetings are for discussion and decisions.
3. **Protect maker time.** If your team does creative or technical work, batch meetings into specific days. Leave at least two days per week meeting-light.
4. **Start with less.** It is easier to add a meeting than to remove one. Start with the minimum and add only when you identify a clear gap.
5. **Model the behavior you expect.** Start on time. End on time. Come prepared. Follow up on commitments.

### What to Kill

In your first 60 days, identify and eliminate at least two meetings or rituals that do not add value. Common candidates:
- Status meetings that could be an email or async update
- Meetings with no decision-maker present
- Meetings where the same information is repeated that was already shared in writing
- Meetings that exist because "we have always done them"

Killing a useless meeting is itself an early win. Teams notice and appreciate it.

## Resource Negotiation Strategies

By day 45-60, you should have enough evidence to negotiate for resources — headcount, budget, tools, or executive attention. Here is how to do it effectively.

### Build the Case Before You Ask

Never walk into a resource conversation empty-handed. Your early wins and learning-phase insights are your evidence.

| Evidence Type | How to Use It |
|--------------|---------------|
| Early-win results | "In my first 6 weeks, we improved [metric] by [X%]. With [resource], we can accelerate this." |
| Data from learning phase | "In my interviews, [N] out of [M] stakeholders identified [X] as a critical gap." |
| Competitive benchmarks | "Our peer companies invest [X] in this area. We are at [Y]." |
| Risk framing | "Without [resource], we are exposed to [specific risk]. Here is the cost of that risk." |
| ROI projection | "An investment of [X] in [resource] would yield [Y] in [timeframe]. Here is the math." |

### Negotiation Tactics

**Start with your boss's priorities, not yours.** Frame every resource request in terms of what your boss cares about. If your boss cares about revenue, frame the request in revenue terms. If they care about customer satisfaction, use that language.

**Ask for what you need, not what you think you can get.** Anchoring matters. If you need three headcount and ask for two, you will get one. Ask for three, justify it, and negotiate from there.

**Offer a trade.** "If I can get [resource], I commit to delivering [specific outcome] by [specific date]." This reduces risk for the person giving you resources.

**Create urgency without being dramatic.** "The window to [capitalize on opportunity / prevent risk] closes in [timeframe]. Here is what we need to act in time."

**Get the commitment in writing.** After a verbal agreement, send a follow-up email summarizing what was agreed. This prevents misunderstandings and creates accountability.

## Communicating Your Strategy Narrative

By day 60, you should be able to articulate a clear narrative about where the team is, where it needs to go, and how you plan to get there. This narrative serves three purposes:

1. It aligns the team around a shared direction
2. It gives stakeholders confidence that you have a plan
3. It creates a framework for decision-making ("Does this move us toward our stated direction?")

### The Narrative Structure

Your strategy narrative should answer five questions, in this order:

1. **Where are we?** (Current state — honest, specific, evidence-based)
2. **Where do we need to go?** (Vision — ambitious but credible)
3. **Why?** (The case for change — what happens if we do nothing)
4. **How will we get there?** (Strategy — the 3-5 big bets you are making)
5. **What will it take?** (Resources, timeline, and what you need from the team)

### Delivery Tips

- Share the narrative first with your boss to ensure alignment
- Then share with your direct reports in a dedicated meeting, not crammed into a status update
- Invite pushback. Say: "This is my best thinking based on what I have learned. I want to hear where you disagree."
- Follow up with a written version that people can reference
- Repeat the narrative consistently. People need to hear a message 5-7 times before it sinks in.

## The 90-Day Self-Assessment

## When to Make Tough Calls

### The Decision Framework

Tough calls — role changes, restructuring, killing projects, changing direction — are the defining moments of your transition. Here is how to think about timing.

**Make the call when:**
- You have enough information (80% confidence, not 100%)
- Delaying would cause more harm than acting
- You have consulted the people who deserve to be consulted
- You have a plan for implementation, not just the decision itself
- You can explain the rationale clearly and honestly

**Wait when:**
- You are acting out of frustration, not strategy
- You have not heard from the people most affected
- The decision is irreversible and your confidence is below 70%
- You do not yet have the credibility to survive the backlash
- There is a natural moment coming soon (quarterly review, team offsite) where the decision will land better

### Making Tough Calls with Integrity

1. **Be direct.** Do not soften the message so much that people do not understand it. "We are eliminating this role" is clearer and more respectful than "We are exploring a potential restructuring of responsibilities."

2. **Explain the why.** People can handle hard news. What they cannot handle is hard news with no explanation. Share the reasoning.

3. **Own the decision.** Do not blame your boss, the market, or the budget. Say: "I made this decision because..."

4. **Acknowledge the impact.** "I know this is difficult. I do not take it lightly." Mean it.

5. **Provide support.** For role changes: offer coaching, training, or transition time. For removals: offer fair severance and help with the job search.

6. **Communicate to the broader team promptly.** After informing the person directly, tell the rest of the team within 24 hours. Rumors are worse than facts.

7. **Do not revisit the decision publicly.** Once made, a decision must be supported. If you second-guess yourself openly, you undermine your credibility and the team's ability to move forward.

## The 90-Day Transition Is Not the End

Day 90 is not a finish line. It is the point where your transition shifts from "new leader mode" to "leader mode." The learning never stops. The relationship-building never stops. The assessment and adjustment never stop.

What changes at day 90 is the pace. The urgent, compressed learning of the first three months gives way to a steadier rhythm. You should now have: a clear diagnosis, a credible strategy, the right team (or a plan to get there), strong relationships with key stakeholders, and enough credibility to drive your agenda.

If you do not have all of these by day 90, that is not failure — it is information. Revisit your approach, adjust your timeline, and keep going. The leaders who succeed in transitions are not the ones who get everything right in 90 days. They are the ones who keep learning and adjusting after 90 days.
