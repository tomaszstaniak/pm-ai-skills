# The STARS Model: Diagnosing Your Situation

The single most important thing you can do in your first week is correctly diagnose the business situation you are entering. Michael Watkins' STARS model provides five archetypes. Your strategy, pace, tone, and priorities all depend on which one you are in — and most leaders get this wrong because they default to the style that worked in their last role.

## The Five STARS Situations

### Start-up

You are building something from nothing — a new product, division, team, or initiative. There is no existing culture, no established processes, and often no team yet.

**Defining characteristics:**

- No legacy systems, processes, or culture to navigate
- High ambiguity about what "good" looks like
- Resource constraints are common but negotiable
- Energy and excitement are high; structure is low
- Decisions happen fast because there are few stakeholders
- Failure modes are about execution speed and focus, not politics

**What the organization expects from you:** Rapid assembly of people, strategy, and infrastructure. Tangible output within 60-90 days. Clear articulation of vision and milestones.

**Your biggest risk:** Trying to build everything at once. Hiring too fast. Confusing activity with progress.

### Turnaround

The business, team, or product is in obvious trouble. Everyone knows it. There may be a burning platform — declining revenue, lost customers, failing product, or demoralized team.

**Defining characteristics:**

- Urgency is real and externally visible
- People are demoralized but often relieved someone is taking charge
- There is usually a "grace period" where bold moves are tolerated
- Data about what went wrong is abundant (though sometimes hidden)
- Quick, visible action is expected
- The previous leader's approach is discredited, giving you freedom

**What the organization expects from you:** Stabilize the situation within 30 days. Identify root causes. Make hard decisions about people and direction. Show a credible path forward.

**Your biggest risk:** Moving too slowly because you want to "understand the full picture." In turnarounds, 80% right and fast beats 100% right and slow.

### Accelerated Growth

The business is succeeding and growing fast. The challenge is scaling — processes, people, and systems that worked at one size are breaking at the next.

**Defining characteristics:**

- Revenue or usage is growing faster than the organization can support
- Founding-era processes are creaking under load
- Key people are stretched thin and burning out
- Culture is strong but fragile — it was built for a smaller team
- There is often resistance to "professionalizing" the operation
- Success masks underlying structural problems

**What the organization expects from you:** Build the scaffolding for the next stage of growth without killing what made the company successful. Hire and develop the team. Introduce process without bureaucracy.

**Your biggest risk:** Imposing big-company processes on a small-company culture. Moving too fast to "fix" things that the team sees as features, not bugs.

### Realignment

The organization is not in crisis, but it is drifting. Performance is adequate but declining, or the market is shifting and the team has not adjusted. The challenge is that people do not believe change is necessary.

**Defining characteristics:**

- No burning platform — performance is "fine" or slowly declining
- Denial is common: "We just need to execute better"
- The previous leader may still be respected or even present
- Political dynamics are complex because the status quo has defenders
- Data alone will not convince people — you need a narrative
- Change must be sold, not imposed

**What the organization expects from you:** This is the tricky part — different stakeholders expect different things. Your boss may want transformation. Your team may want stability. You must align these expectations early.

**Your biggest risk:** Underestimating resistance. In turnarounds, people welcome change. In realignments, they fight it because they do not believe it is needed.

### Sustaining Success

The organization is performing well. Your job is to maintain momentum, find the next wave of growth, and avoid complacency.

**Defining characteristics:**

- High-performing team with strong culture
- Expectations are sky-high — you are replacing a successful leader
- The team is watching closely to see if you will "mess things up"
- Innovation risk: the team may be optimizing the current model at the expense of future positioning
- Your freedom to make changes is limited early on
- Listening and learning matter more here than in any other situation

**What the organization expects from you:** Do not break what works. Find incremental improvements. Prepare for the next strategic challenge. Earn trust before making changes.

**Your biggest risk:** Changing things to "put your stamp" on the organization. Making changes that signal you do not respect what came before.

## Handling Hybrid Situations

Most real-world transitions are hybrids. Your product team may be in a turnaround while your engineering team is in accelerated growth. One region may be a start-up while another is sustaining success.

### How to Map a Hybrid

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | List every unit/function you oversee | Org inventory |
| 2 | For each, assign a primary STARS category | Initial map |
| 3 | For each, assign a secondary category if applicable | Refined map |
| 4 | Identify which unit demands the most urgent attention | Priority list |
| 5 | Check for conflicts between units | Risk register |

### Common Hybrid Patterns

- **Turnaround + Start-up:** You must stabilize one area while building another from scratch. Sequence matters — stabilize first, then build.
- **Accelerated Growth + Realignment:** Part of the org is scaling and part needs redirection. The growing part will consume your attention if you let it. Force yourself to allocate time to the realignment.
- **Sustaining Success + Turnaround:** One function is thriving, another is failing. Resist the temptation to apply the successful function's playbook to the failing one.

### Key Rule for Hybrids

Allocate your time based on where the highest risk is, not where you feel most comfortable. Most leaders gravitate toward the STARS situation that matches their natural style. Force yourself to spend disproportionate time on the situation that is least natural for you.

## Diagnostic Interview Questions

Use these questions in your first two weeks. Ask them of your boss, peers, direct reports, and key stakeholders. The pattern of answers will reveal your STARS situation.

### Universal Questions (Ask Everyone)

1. What is the biggest challenge facing this team/organization right now?
2. If you could change one thing about how this team operates, what would it be?
3. What has been tried before that did not work? Why did it fail?
4. What is working well that I should be careful not to disrupt?
5. Where are we losing customers, talent, or momentum?

### Start-up Diagnostic Questions

6. What is the core hypothesis we are testing with this initiative?
7. What resources have been committed, and what is contingent on early results?
8. Who are the first three hires we need, and why?
9. What does "success at 90 days" look like for this initiative?
10. What existing organizational assets can we leverage (brand, distribution, technology)?
11. Who is the executive sponsor, and how engaged are they?

### Turnaround Diagnostic Questions

6. When did performance start declining, and what changed?
7. Who are the key people I cannot afford to lose during this transition?
8. What decisions have been deferred that need to be made immediately?
9. Are there any "sacred cows" — things everyone knows are broken but no one will touch?
10. What is the cash/budget runway? How much time do we have?
11. Who left recently, and why?

### Accelerated Growth Diagnostic Questions

6. Where are the biggest bottlenecks to scaling?
7. Which processes are manual today that need to be automated or systematized?
8. Where is the team most stretched? Who is at risk of burnout?
9. What was the last major hire that did not work out, and why?
10. What part of the culture are people most afraid of losing as we grow?
11. What decisions are stuck because there is no clear owner?

### Realignment Diagnostic Questions

6. What would you say if I told you this team needs significant change? (Watch the reaction.)
7. When was the last time the strategy was seriously re-evaluated?
8. Who are the strongest defenders of the current approach?
9. What external signals suggest we need to adapt?
10. If a new competitor entered the market today, where would they attack us?
11. What do customers complain about most?

### Sustaining Success Diagnostic Questions

6. What made the previous leader effective? What will be missed?
7. Where is the team coasting on past success?
8. What is the next big strategic bet this team should make?
9. If performance dipped 20% next quarter, what would be the likely cause?
10. What talent do we need that we do not have?
11. What is the team's biggest blind spot?

| 31-50 | Identify hidden risks | Look for complacency, single points of failure, and strategic blind spots. |
| 51-70 | Propose incremental improvements | Suggest 2-3 targeted improvements. Frame them as building on success, not fixing failure. |
| 71-90 | Earn the right to lead change | Demonstrate respect for the team's history. Begin seeding ideas for longer-term strategic shifts. |

## Common Misdiagnosis Patterns

| Misdiagnosis | Why It Happens | Consequence | How to Avoid |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Treating a realignment as a turnaround | You see declining metrics and assume crisis | You move too aggressively and alienate the team | Check: Is the team aware of the problem? If not, it is a realignment. |
| Treating a turnaround as a realignment | You want to be diplomatic and take time | You move too slowly and the situation worsens | Check: Is there a burning platform? If yes, act with urgency. |
| Treating accelerated growth as sustaining success | Growth masks problems | Scaling bottlenecks become crises | Check: Is the team stretched? Are processes breaking? If yes, it is accelerated growth. |
| Treating sustaining success as accelerated growth | You want to make changes | You over-engineer and disrupt a high-performing team | Check: Is the team asking for help scaling? If not, listen more. |
| Applying your last role's playbook | Familiarity bias | You solve the wrong problem | Force yourself to complete the diagnostic before choosing a strategy. |

## Final Note

Revisit your STARS assessment at day 30 and day 60. Your initial diagnosis will almost certainly need refinement as you learn more. The goal is not to get it perfect on day one — it is to have a working hypothesis that you actively test and update. The leaders who fail in transitions are not the ones who misdiagnose initially. They are the ones who never revisit their diagnosis.
