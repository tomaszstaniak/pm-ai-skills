# The First 90 Days

A structured framework for accelerating leadership transitions. Based on Michael D. Watkins' "The First 90 Days" — the definitive playbook for anyone starting a new role, whether it's a promotion, a lateral move, or joining a new company. The first 90 days set the trajectory for everything that follows.

## Core Principle

**Transitions are the most critical — and most dangerous — times in a leader's career.** What you do in the first 90 days will largely determine whether you succeed or fail. The actions you take during your transition establish your reputation, shape how people perceive you, and build (or destroy) momentum. There is no "figuring it out as you go" — you need a plan.

The fundamental challenge: you are simultaneously learning (absorbing massive amounts of new information) and being judged (people form opinions about you quickly and update them slowly). This dual pressure is what makes transitions so hard and so consequential.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When evaluating a transition plan, rate 0-10:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0-2 | No plan. Winging it. No structured learning or relationship building. |
| 3-4 | Basic plan exists but doesn't account for the business situation (STARS). Key conversations are unplanned. |
| 5-6 | Reasonable plan with learning goals and stakeholder mapping, but missing early wins or cultural adaptation strategy. |
| 7-8 | Strong plan. STARS diagnosis done, 5 conversations planned, early wins identified, team assessment underway. |
| 9-10 | Exceptional. Full 90-day plan with clear phases, situation-appropriate strategy, coalition built, early wins secured, and personal adaptive challenges addressed. |

## The STARS Model: Diagnose Your Situation

**Before making any plans, diagnose the business situation you're entering.** Different situations demand fundamentally different strategies. The STARS model identifies five common situations:

| Situation | What it is | Your primary job | Key danger |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **S**tart-up | Building something new from scratch | Assemble team, get resources, build from zero | Moving too fast without a plan; burning out |
| **T**urnaround | Saving a business in serious trouble | Make hard calls fast, stop the bleeding | Not acting fast enough; trying to please everyone |
| **A**ccelerated Growth | Managing rapid scaling | Put structure in place without killing what works | Adding too much process; or too little, and things break |
| **R**ealignment | Fixing an organization that doesn't know it's in trouble | Convince people change is needed, then lead it | People don't see the problem; resistance to change |
| **S**ustaining Success | Maintaining a winning organization | Preserve what works, find the next growth curve | Complacency; "if it ain't broke..." thinking; or changing things that shouldn't change |

**Key insights:**
- Most roles are a mix of STARS situations across different parts of the organization
- The biggest mistake is applying a Turnaround playbook to a Sustaining Success situation (or vice versa)
- Your team's perception of the situation may differ from reality — Realignment is the hardest because people don't agree there's a problem
- Ask: "What STARS situation is each part of my organization in?"

**Product applications:**

| Context | Application | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| New PM joining a team | Diagnose before prescribing | "This team is in Realignment — metrics look OK but growth has stalled. I need to build the case for change before pushing new processes." |
| New engineering manager | Adapt management style to situation | "Start-up mode: I need to recruit fast and establish technical direction. Turnaround: I need to fix reliability before adding features." |
| Promotion within same company | Don't assume you know the situation | "I knew this team as a peer. But now that I'm leading it, I see it's in Accelerated Growth — the processes that worked for 5 people break at 15." |

**Copy patterns:**
- "This is a [STARS situation]. That means my first priority is [primary job], and the biggest risk is [key danger]."
- "Different parts of my org are in different STARS situations: [team A] is in [situation], [team B] is in [situation]. My approach must differ for each."
- "I initially thought this was a Turnaround. After 10 interviews, I realize it's a Realignment — the team doesn't see the problem yet."

**Ethical boundary:** Never misdiagnose the STARS situation to justify a preferred leadership style. If you love Turnarounds but you've inherited a Sustaining Success, don't manufacture a crisis to play hero. Honest diagnosis protects the team.

## The 30-60-90 Day Framework

### Days 1-30: Learn

**Goal:** Absorb. Understand the landscape before acting.

| Action | How | Output |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Understand the business situation (STARS) | Interviews, data review, observation | Written STARS diagnosis |
| Map key stakeholders | Identify: boss, peers, direct reports, key influencers, hidden power brokers | Stakeholder map with relationships and interests |
| Learn the culture | Observe: how are decisions made? What's rewarded? What's punished? What's the real org chart vs. formal? | Cultural assessment notes |
| Have the 5 Conversations with your boss | (see below) | Aligned expectations document |
| Identify the "A players" on your team | Who delivers? Who is respected by peers? Who do people go to for advice? | Early team assessment |

**Traps to avoid in days 1-30:**
- Coming in with "the answer" — you don't understand the context yet
- Making promises you can't keep
- Criticizing how things were done before you arrived
- Spending all your time with your direct reports and ignoring peers

**Copy patterns:**
- "In my first 30 days, I'm here to learn, not to fix. My goal is to understand before I act."
- "I've scheduled conversations with [N] people across [functions] to build a complete picture."
- "Here's what I've learned so far, and here's what I still don't understand."

**Ethical boundary:** Never fake the learning phase. If you've already decided what to change, pretending to listen while waiting to announce your plan destroys trust faster than acting without consultation.

See: [references/learning-phase.md](references/learning-phase.md)

### Days 31-60: Shape

**Goal:** Develop your strategy and secure early wins.

| Action | How | Output |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Identify early wins | Find problems that are visible, solvable, and aligned with your boss's priorities | 2-3 early win targets |
| Build your coalition | Identify supporters, opponents, and persuadables. Invest time in persuadables. | Coalition map |
| Align the team | Share your emerging vision. Listen to pushback. Adjust. | Team alignment session |
| Start making calls | Begin decisions that demonstrate your priorities | First visible decisions |
| Deepen stakeholder relationships | Regular 1:1s with key peers and cross-functional partners | Relationship momentum |

**Early wins criteria:**
- Visible to people who matter
- Achievable within 30-60 days
- Consistent with the direction you want to go
- Not a "quick fix" that creates long-term debt

**Copy patterns:**
- "I've identified [N] early wins that are visible, achievable, and directionally correct: [list]."
- "This early win demonstrates [the principle I want to establish] — it's not just a fix, it's a signal."
- "My coalition includes [supporters]. I'm investing time in [persuadables] because they'll determine whether change sticks."

**Ethical boundary:** Early wins must be genuine improvements, not manufactured victories. Taking credit for work already in progress, or creating easy problems to solve, undermines credibility. The team will see through it.

See: [references/early-wins.md](references/early-wins.md)

### Days 61-90: Accelerate

**Goal:** Drive change and build momentum.

| Action | How | Output |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Refine team structure | Make necessary changes — role adjustments, performance conversations, hiring | Team plan |
| Secure resources | Use early wins as evidence to request what you need | Budget/headcount decisions |
| Establish your operating rhythm | Meetings, reviews, rituals that embed your priorities | Recurring cadence |
| Communicate the strategy | Tell the story: here's where we are, here's where we're going, here's how we get there | Strategy narrative |
| Self-assessment | What's working? What's not? What have I learned about myself? | Personal retrospective |

**Copy patterns:**
- "At 90 days, here's where we are: [progress on outcome], [team changes made], [rhythm established]."
- "I've established [operating rhythm] because it embeds [priority] into how we work daily."
- "My 90-day self-assessment: [what worked], [what I'd do differently], [what I learned about this organization]."

**Ethical boundary:** The acceleration phase requires making hard calls — role changes, resource reallocation, stopping initiatives. These decisions must be grounded in the learning from days 1-60, not in pre-existing biases. If you can't point to specific evidence for each decision, slow down.

See: [references/acceleration-phase.md](references/acceleration-phase.md)

## The 5 Conversations with Your Boss

**The most important relationship in your first 90 days.** Have these 5 conversations early and explicitly:

| Conversation | Purpose | Key questions |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **1. Situational diagnosis** | Agree on the STARS situation | "How do you see the current state of the team/business? What's working? What's not?" |
| **2. Expectations** | Align on what success looks like | "What do you expect me to accomplish in 30/60/90 days? What does success look like at 6 months?" |
| **3. Resources** | Negotiate for what you need | "What resources (people, budget, tools) are available? What constraints should I know about?" |
| **4. Style** | Learn how your boss works | "How do you prefer to communicate? How often? What decisions do you want to be involved in?" |
| **5. Personal development** | Get feedback early | "What should I watch out for? Where might my background be a disadvantage here?" |

**Key insights:**
- Don't try to have all 5 in one meeting — spread them across the first 30 days
- These conversations are two-way — share your perspective too
- Revisit expectations regularly. What your boss cares about will shift.
- Underpromise and overdeliver. Reset unrealistic expectations early rather than failing to meet them later.

**Copy patterns:**
- "Here's how I understand the situation [conversation 1]. Here's what I think success looks like [conversation 2]. Here's what I need to get there [conversation 3]."
- "I prefer [communication style]. How do you prefer to stay informed? What decisions need your input vs. what can I own? [conversation 4]"
- "Where should I watch out for blind spots given my background? [conversation 5]"

**Ethical boundary:** These conversations require honesty in both directions. Never tell your boss what they want to hear to create a favorable impression. If the situation is worse than they think, say so. Misaligned expectations are the #1 cause of transition failure, and they compound with time.

See: [references/five-conversations.md](references/five-conversations.md)

## Common Transition Traps

| Trap | What it looks like | Fix |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| **Sticking with what you know** | Engineer-turned-manager keeps writing code instead of leading | Identify what got you here vs. what will get you there. Let go of the old role. |
| **Coming in with "the answer"** | New leader announces a transformation in week 2 | Spend 30 days learning before prescribing. |
| **Setting unrealistic expectations** | Promising to fix everything in 90 days | Have the expectations conversation early. Under-promise. |
| **Neglecting horizontal relationships** | Only focusing on direct reports and boss | Peers and cross-functional partners determine your success as much as your team does. |
| **Trying to do too much** | 15 initiatives in the first quarter | Pick 2-3 early wins. Focus creates momentum; scatter destroys it. |
| **Not adapting to the culture** | Imposing your old company's way of working | Observe first. Understand why things are done this way before changing them. |
| **Treating every situation the same** | Using a turnaround playbook in a sustaining-success role | Use STARS to diagnose, then match your approach to the situation. |

## Quick Diagnostic

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Have you diagnosed your STARS situation? | Flying blind — your strategy might not match the context | Interview 5 people and classify each area of your org |
| Have you had the 5 conversations with your boss? | Misaligned expectations — the #1 cause of transition failure | Schedule them this week |
| Do you have 2-3 specific early wins identified? | No momentum — people haven't seen you deliver yet | Find a visible, achievable, directionally-correct win |
| Have you mapped your key stakeholders? | You don't know who can help or block you | Create a stakeholder map: supporters, opponents, persuadables |
| Have you built peer relationships (not just your team)? | Isolated — cross-functional influence is where things get done | Schedule 1:1s with 5 key peers in the next 2 weeks |
