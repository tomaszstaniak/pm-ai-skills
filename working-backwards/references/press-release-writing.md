# Writing the Fictional Press Release

The press release is the centerpiece of Amazon's Working Backwards process. It is not a marketing exercise. It is a thinking tool that forces you to articulate what you are building, who it is for, and why they should care — before you write a single line of code or allocate a single dollar of budget.

This guide walks through each section of the press release, explains what it must accomplish, and provides templates and examples across product types.

## Why a Press Release and Not a Product Brief

A product brief describes what you plan to build. A press release describes what the customer experiences after you have built it. That distinction matters enormously. Product briefs allow you to hide behind technical descriptions and internal jargon. A press release written for an external audience forces clarity because you must explain the product in terms a customer would understand and find compelling.

Colin Bryar and Bill Carr describe the press release as the "forcing function" that separates genuine customer value from internal enthusiasm. If you cannot write a press release that sounds exciting to a real customer, the product idea is not ready.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### 1. Headline

The headline is the single most important sentence in the document. It must communicate the customer benefit, not the product feature.

**The rule:** A reader who sees only the headline should understand what problem is being solved and for whom.

| Weak Headline | Problem | Strong Headline |
|---|---|---|
| "Acme Launches AI-Powered Analytics Platform" | Feature, not benefit. Who cares about "AI-powered"? | "Acme Helps Marketing Teams Cut Reporting Time from Days to Minutes" |
| "New Integration Framework for Enterprise Customers" | Jargon. No clear benefit. | "Enterprise Teams Can Now Connect All Their Tools in Under an Hour" |
| "Introducing PhotoStream 2.0" | Version number means nothing to customers. | "PhotoStream Now Automatically Organizes Your Photos by the People and Places You Love" |

**Template:** `[Company/Product] [Helps/Enables/Lets] [Specific Customer] [Achieve Specific Outcome]`

Do not use superlatives ("revolutionary," "groundbreaking," "world-class"). Do not use technical terms the customer would not use in conversation with a friend. Do not reference internal project names.

### 2. Subheadline

One sentence that expands on the headline. It should either quantify the benefit or add a second compelling dimension.

**Examples:**
- Headline: "Acme Helps Marketing Teams Cut Reporting Time from Days to Minutes"
- Subheadline: "Free tier available for teams of up to five, with no credit card required."

The subheadline often addresses a secondary concern: price, availability, ease of adoption, or compatibility.

### 3. Opening Paragraph

The opening paragraph must answer four questions in three to four sentences:

1. **Who** is the customer?
2. **What** is the product or service?
3. **What** benefit does it deliver?
4. **How** can the customer get it?

This is where most press releases fail. Writers spend the opening paragraph on company history, market context, or technical architecture. None of that belongs here. The customer does not care about your company's journey. They care about their problem and your solution.

**The "So What" Test:** Read every sentence and ask "so what?" from the customer's perspective. If the sentence does not survive that test, cut it.

| Sentence | "So What" Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| "After two years of development, Acme is proud to announce..." | Customer does not care about your timeline. | Cut. |
| "Leveraging proprietary machine learning algorithms..." | Customer does not care about your technology stack. | Cut. |
| "Small business owners can now generate tax-ready financial reports in one click." | Solves a real pain point with a clear mechanism. | Keep. |

### 4. Customer Quote

A fictional quote from a representative customer. This is not a testimonial — it is a design tool. Writing in the customer's voice forces you to empathize with their experience.

The quote should express:
- The problem they had before the product existed
- How the product changed their situation
- An emotional or practical outcome

**Weak quote:** "This product is amazing and I love using it every day."

**Strong quote:** "I used to spend every Sunday evening dreading the Monday morning report. Now it is waiting in my inbox when I wake up. I actually had dinner with my family last Sunday for the first time in months."

The strong quote is specific, situational, and emotionally grounded. It tells a micro-story. It makes the benefit tangible.

**Guidance for writing customer quotes:**
- Use the customer's language, not yours
- Include a specific before/after contrast
- Reference a real scenario, not an abstract benefit
- Keep it under four sentences

### 5. Problem Paragraph

Describe the current state of the world without your product. What is painful, slow, expensive, or frustrating? Be specific. Use numbers where possible.

**Template:** "Today, [customer segment] faces [specific problem]. [Quantify the pain: time, money, error rate, frustration]. Existing solutions [describe why they fall short]. As a result, [describe the downstream consequence]."

**Example:** "Today, hiring managers at mid-size companies spend an average of 23 hours per open role on initial resume screening. Existing applicant tracking systems filter on keywords, missing qualified candidates with non-traditional backgrounds and advancing unqualified candidates with optimized resumes. As a result, 40% of first-round interviews are wasted on poor-fit candidates."

### 6. Solution Paragraph

Describe how the product solves the problem stated above. This must map directly to the pain points — every problem raised in the previous section should have a corresponding solution here.

**Common pitfall:** The solution paragraph describes features instead of outcomes. "Our product uses natural language processing to parse resumes" is a feature. "Hiring managers see a ranked shortlist of candidates most likely to succeed in the role, based on skills demonstrated in past work rather than keyword matches" is an outcome.

### 7. Getting Started Paragraph

Explain how the customer begins using the product. This section tests whether you have thought through the onboarding experience. If the getting started process is complicated, that is a signal the product design needs more work.

**Rule of thumb:** If the getting started paragraph is longer than three sentences, the onboarding is too complex.

### 8. Company Spokesperson Quote

A quote from a leader at the company. Unlike the customer quote, this one explains the company's motivation and vision. It should convey why the company invested in solving this problem and hint at the broader direction.

This quote is the one place where company perspective is appropriate. Even here, it should connect back to the customer: "We built this because we kept hearing from customers that..."

## Before and After Examples

### Example 1: B2B SaaS

**Before (Weak):**

> **Acme Announces Next-Generation Customer Success Platform**
>
> Acme, a leader in customer success technology, today announced the release of Acme 3.0, its most advanced platform to date. Built on a microservices architecture with real-time data streaming capabilities, Acme 3.0 represents two years of engineering investment. The platform leverages machine learning to provide predictive analytics and automated workflows. "We are thrilled to bring this innovative solution to market," said the CEO.

**Problems:** Feature-focused headline. Self-congratulatory tone. Technical architecture details. No customer benefit. No specificity about who this is for. The CEO quote says nothing.

**After (Strong):**

> **Acme Alerts Customer Success Teams Before At-Risk Accounts Cancel**
>
> Reduces surprise churn by up to 40% by identifying disengagement patterns 60 days before cancellation.
>
> San Francisco, CA — Acme today launched early warning capabilities that alert customer success managers when accounts show signs of disengagement, weeks before the customer considers canceling. SaaS companies with 500+ accounts currently lose an average of 8% of revenue annually to churn they did not see coming. Acme monitors product usage, support ticket patterns, and engagement signals to flag at-risk accounts while there is still time to intervene.
>
> "Last quarter, three of our largest accounts canceled and we had no idea they were unhappy. With Acme, we caught two similar situations this month and saved both accounts. That is $400K in ARR we would have lost." — Sarah Chen, VP of Customer Success at a 200-person SaaS company
>
> Getting started requires connecting your product analytics and CRM. Setup takes under an hour. Free 30-day trial for teams managing 100+ accounts.

### Example 2: Consumer App

**Before (Weak):**

> **FitLog Launches Revolutionary AI Fitness Tracking App**
>
> FitLog Inc. is excited to announce FitLog, a groundbreaking fitness app that uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to revolutionize how people track their workouts. The app features state-of-the-art pose estimation technology. "This is a game-changer for the fitness industry," said the founder.

**After (Strong):**

> **FitLog Counts Your Reps So You Can Focus on Your Workout**
>
> Just prop up your phone and exercise. FitLog watches your form and tracks every set automatically.
>
> Anyone who has tried to track workouts manually knows the frustration: you lose count mid-set, you forget to log exercises, and by the end of the week your training log is a mess of guesses. FitLog watches your workout through your phone's camera and counts every rep, logs every set, and flags when your form breaks down.
>
> "I used to pause between every set to type into my phone. Now I just work out. When I am done, everything is already logged perfectly. I did not realize how much the tracking was interrupting my focus until I stopped doing it." — Marcus, recreational lifter for six years

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Writing for your boss instead of your customer | The press release becomes an internal justification document, not a customer-facing story | Before each draft, write the name of one specific customer persona at the top of the page. Write for them. |
| Passive voice throughout | "Insights are surfaced by the platform" hides agency and sounds corporate | Use active voice: "The platform surfaces insights" or better, "[Customer] sees insights" |
| Jargon and acronyms | "ML-powered NLP engine with API-first architecture" means nothing to most customers | Replace every technical term with the outcome it enables. If you cannot, the term stays. |
| Listing features instead of outcomes | A feature list does not answer "why should I care?" | For every feature, complete the sentence: "which means the customer can now..." |
| Vague quantification | "Saves significant time" is not compelling | Replace with specific numbers: "reduces from 3 hours to 15 minutes" |
| No clear customer segment | "Designed for businesses of all sizes" means designed for no one | Name the specific segment: "mid-market e-commerce teams with 10-50 SKUs" |
| Burying the lead | The most compelling benefit appears in paragraph four | Move the strongest customer benefit to the headline and opening sentence |

## The Iteration Process

A press release is not written once. At Amazon, press releases go through multiple revisions before they are considered ready. The typical process:

1. **First draft:** Get the structure down. Fill every section. Do not worry about polish.
2. **"So what" pass:** Read every sentence through the customer's eyes. Cut anything that fails.
3. **Specificity pass:** Replace every vague claim with a specific number, example, or scenario.
4. **Jargon pass:** Circle every word the customer would not use. Replace or explain each one.
5. **Peer review:** Have someone unfamiliar with the project read it. If they cannot explain the product back to you in one sentence, the press release is not clear enough.
6. **Leadership review:** Present the press release in a silent reading session. Collect written feedback. Revise.

The press release is a living document throughout the development process. When trade-offs arise during implementation, return to the press release and ask: "Does this decision still deliver what we promised the customer?" If not, either change the decision or update the press release and re-evaluate whether the product is still worth building.
