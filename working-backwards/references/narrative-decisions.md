# Narrative Decision-Making

In 2004, Jeff Bezos banned PowerPoint presentations from Amazon executive meetings. In their place, he required written narrative documents — structured prose that forces the author to think clearly and gives the reader a complete picture. This was not a stylistic preference. It was a deliberate decision-making architecture designed to produce better outcomes at scale.

This guide explains the reasoning behind narrative decision-making, the practical mechanics of writing and reviewing narrative documents, and how to adapt the practice for organizations that are not Amazon.

## Why Narratives Over Slide Decks

The core problem with slide decks is structural. Bullet points allow the presenter to gesture at ideas without fully developing them. A bullet that reads "Significant market opportunity" hides the analytical work: How large is the market? How was it measured? What share is realistically capturable? What are the assumptions? In a slide deck, those questions are answered verbally — or not at all.

Bezos articulated the problem in a 2004 memo to his leadership team: "The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than 'writing' a 20 page PowerPoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what."

### The Structural Argument

A well-written narrative has an internal logic that bullet points cannot replicate. Consider the difference:

**Bullet point version:**
- Large addressable market ($4.2B)
- Growing 18% annually
- Fragmented competitive landscape
- Our technology is differentiated
- Strong unit economics

These five bullets look compelling. But they hide critical connections:
- Is the $4.2B total addressable market or serviceable addressable market?
- Is the 18% growth rate for the total market or the segment we are targeting?
- Is the competitive landscape fragmented because the market is early or because the problem is not worth solving at scale?
- How does our differentiation map to what customers actually value?
- Are the unit economics based on current pricing or projected pricing?

**Narrative version:**

"The market for mid-market customer success software is approximately $1.2B in annual recurring revenue, growing at 18% annually according to Gartner's 2024 report. This is a segment of the broader $4.2B CRM market, but we are specifically targeting mid-market companies with 50-500 employees that have outgrown spreadsheet-based customer tracking but cannot justify the cost and complexity of enterprise platforms like Salesforce. The competitive landscape is fragmented: 23 vendors serve this segment, none with more than 8% market share. This fragmentation exists because the segment has historically been underserved by enterprise vendors who optimize for larger deals and by SMB tools that lack the workflow complexity mid-market operations require. Our differentiation is in onboarding speed — our architecture allows full deployment in under two hours versus the industry average of three weeks — which directly addresses the primary objection mid-market buyers cite when evaluating solutions."

The narrative version makes the logical connections explicit. Each sentence builds on the previous one. Gaps in reasoning are visible because the author cannot hide behind a bullet's ambiguity.

### The Comprehension Argument

Research on information processing supports narrative decision-making. Humans process narratives differently from lists. Stories and connected prose activate causal reasoning — the reader is constantly asking "why?" and "so what?" as they read. Lists activate categorization — the reader sorts items into mental buckets but does not naturally build connections between them.

In a meeting context, this means that a group that reads a narrative document starts discussion with a shared understanding of the argument's structure. A group that watches a slide presentation starts discussion with individual interpretations of disconnected points, and much of the meeting time is spent aligning those interpretations.

### The Equity Argument

Slide presentations favor the presenter. The person standing at the front of the room controls the pace, emphasis, and framing. A charismatic presenter can make a weak argument look strong. A nervous presenter can make a strong argument look weak. The format rewards presentation skill, not analytical quality.

Narrative documents equalize the playing field. The document stands on its own. A junior analyst with a well-reasoned six-pager is evaluated on the same terms as a senior director. The quality of the thinking speaks for itself because the medium does not amplify or diminish the messenger.

## The Six-Pager Format

Amazon's six-pager is the most common format for significant decisions. It is not always literally six pages — the point is that it is a complete, self-contained document of appropriate length. The name serves as shorthand for a disciplined approach to document length: long enough to be thorough, short enough to be read and discussed in a single meeting.

### Structure of a Six-Pager

While there is no rigid template, effective six-pagers typically follow this structure:

**1. Introduction (half page)**

State the purpose of the document. What decision is being requested? What is the context? The reader should know within the first paragraph what this document is about and what is being asked of them.

**2. Current State (one page)**

Describe the situation as it exists today. What is working? What is not working? What has changed that makes this decision timely? Include data. Avoid editorializing — let the facts build the case.

**3. The Proposal (one to two pages)**

Describe what you are proposing, in detail. Not just "what" but "how." Include specifics: timelines, resource requirements, dependencies, phasing. This is the core of the document.

**4. Alternatives Considered (half to one page)**

Describe the other options you evaluated and why you rejected them. This section demonstrates rigor. If you did not seriously consider alternatives, the proposal looks like a foregone conclusion, not a reasoned decision.

**5. Risks and Mitigations (half to one page)**

What could go wrong? What will you do about it? Be specific and honest. This section builds trust. A proposal that claims to have no risks is not credible.

**6. Financial Impact and Metrics (half to one page)**

Quantify the expected impact. Define how success will be measured. Include both the investment required and the expected return. State the assumptions behind the numbers.

### Writing Guidelines

**Use complete sentences and paragraphs.** No bullet points in the body of the document. If you find yourself reaching for a bullet list, it usually means you have not thought through the logical connections between the items. Tables are acceptable for data presentation.

**Be specific.** Replace "significant revenue opportunity" with "$2.3M in incremental annual revenue based on current pipeline conversion rates." Replace "many customers have requested this" with "47 customers mentioned this in quarterly business reviews in Q3, representing $8.2M in ARR."

**Use topic sentences.** Every paragraph should start with a sentence that tells the reader what the paragraph is about. A reader who reads only the first sentence of every paragraph should be able to follow the document's argument.

**Write in active voice.** "The team will build the integration in Q2" is clearer than "The integration is planned to be built in Q2." Active voice assigns responsibility and communicates confidence.

**Define terms.** Do not assume the reader shares your vocabulary. If you use an acronym, spell it out on first use. If you reference a metric, explain how it is calculated.

**Cut ruthlessly.** After writing the first draft, go through every sentence and ask: "Does this sentence advance the argument?" If it provides background that the reader already knows, cut it. If it repeats a point made earlier, cut it. If it is hedging language ("we believe," "it is possible that," "in our opinion"), either commit to the statement or remove it.

## The Silent Reading Protocol

The silent reading meeting is the companion practice to narrative documents. It ensures that everyone in the room reads the document before discussing it, eliminating the common problem of participants who skim or skip pre-reads.

### How It Works

1. **Document distribution:** The document is distributed at the start of the meeting, not in advance. This ensures that everyone reads it fresh and no one has had time to form alliances or pre-arguments.

2. **Silent reading period:** The first 20 to 30 minutes of the meeting are spent in silence. Everyone reads the document at their own pace. No phones, no laptops (unless reading the document digitally), no side conversations.

3. **Annotation:** Readers are encouraged to mark up the document as they read: underline claims they want to challenge, circle data points they want to verify, write questions in the margins.

4. **Discussion:** After the reading period, the meeting leader opens the floor. Discussion typically starts with questions and challenges to specific sections of the document rather than general reactions.

### Why Silent Reading Works

**It eliminates the pre-read problem.** In most organizations, pre-reads are not read. Meeting participants arrive having skimmed the executive summary or nothing at all. The presentation then becomes a remedial briefing rather than a decision-making discussion. Silent reading guarantees that everyone has read the full document.

**It creates a level playing field.** Slow readers and fast readers both get the time they need. People who process information by reading (rather than listening) are no longer disadvantaged. Non-native language speakers have time to work through complex sections.

**It changes the nature of discussion.** When everyone has read the same document, the discussion is about the content, not the presentation. Questions are specific: "In the third paragraph of page four, you state that churn will decrease by 15% — what is that based on?" rather than general: "Tell me more about the retention strategy."

**It improves document quality over time.** When authors know their document will be read carefully and discussed in detail, they invest more effort in making it clear, accurate, and well-reasoned. Sloppy thinking that might survive a slide deck does not survive a silent reading session.

### Running a Silent Reading Meeting

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|---|---|---|
| Distribution | 2 minutes | Hand out printed copies or share the document link. Confirm everyone can access it. |
| Silent reading | 20-30 minutes | Everyone reads in silence. The facilitator watches for when most people have finished. |
| Initial reactions | 5 minutes | Quick round-the-table: each person shares their single biggest question or concern in one sentence. |
| Structured discussion | 30-45 minutes | Work through the document section by section. The author answers questions and takes notes. |
| Decision | 10 minutes | If a decision is needed, make it. If more work is needed, define specific next steps with owners and dates. |

**Practical tips for the facilitator:**
- Bring printed copies. Reading on paper encourages annotation and reduces distraction.
- Set a timer for the silent reading period. When it goes off, allow two more minutes for people to finish their current section.
- If the meeting has more than eight participants, collect written questions during the reading period to structure the discussion.
- Protect the author. The discussion should challenge ideas, not attack the writer. Redirect personal criticism back to the content.

## How Narrative Structure Forces Logical Thinking

The act of writing a narrative document is itself a thinking tool. This is not a metaphor — the cognitive work required to produce connected prose is qualitatively different from the work required to produce bullet points.

When writing a slide deck, the author's task is to identify the key points and arrange them in a logical order. The connections between points are implied. The author can — consciously or unconsciously — skip over gaps in logic because the format does not require making those connections explicit.

When writing a narrative, the author must do three additional things:

1. **Explain causation.** "Revenue will grow because..." requires specifying the mechanism. A bullet that says "Revenue growth" does not.

2. **Sequence arguments.** Each paragraph must follow from the previous one. If the logical chain breaks, the prose reads poorly and the author is forced to fix it.

3. **Confront contradictions.** In a list, contradictory points can coexist because the reader does not notice them. In a narrative, the author encounters them during writing and must resolve them.

These three requirements — causation, sequencing, and contradiction resolution — are the essence of analytical thinking. The narrative format does not just communicate thinking; it produces thinking.

## Adapting Narrative Decision-Making for Your Organization

Most organizations cannot flip a switch from slide decks to narratives overnight. The transition requires deliberate change management. Here is a practical roadmap:

### Phase 1: Introduction (Months 1-2)

**Start with one team or one meeting type.** Pick a recurring decision-making meeting — a product review, a quarterly planning session, or an investment committee. Announce that this specific meeting will use written documents instead of slides.

**Provide templates and examples.** People cannot write good narrative documents without seeing good narrative documents. Create two to three examples relevant to your organization. Share the six-pager structure. Offer office hours for people preparing their first document.

**Expect resistance.** Common objections and responses:

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "This takes too much time to write." | "Yes, it takes more time to write. It takes less time to make a good decision. The total time invested decreases." |
| "Not everyone is a good writer." | "Writing quality improves with practice. The first documents will be rough. That is expected. The thinking quality improves immediately." |
| "Our culture is verbal — we need discussion." | "There will still be discussion. The document ensures that discussion is focused and productive rather than a rambling briefing." |
| "Slides work fine for us." | "Run both formats in parallel for one quarter. Compare the quality of decisions and the time spent in meetings. Let the results decide." |

### Phase 2: Refinement (Months 3-4)

**Collect feedback after every narrative meeting.** What worked? What was confusing? Were the documents too long, too short, too vague, too detailed?

**Develop organization-specific norms.** How long should documents be for different decision types? What sections are required? What level of financial detail is expected? These norms emerge from practice, not from mandate.

**Identify and celebrate strong documents.** When someone writes a particularly clear and well-reasoned document, share it (with permission) as an example. Positive reinforcement accelerates adoption.

### Phase 3: Expansion (Months 5-8)

**Expand to additional meetings and teams.** Let early adopters evangelize. Teams that have experienced the benefits of narrative decision-making become the most effective advocates.

**Reduce slide deck usage gradually.** Rather than banning slides outright, create clear guidelines: slides are appropriate for status updates and information sharing; narratives are required for decisions and proposals.

**Train new employees.** Include narrative writing in onboarding. Pair new employees with experienced narrative writers for their first document.

### Phase 4: Institutionalization (Months 9-12)

**Make narrative documents the default.** At this point, the question should shift from "why would we write a document?" to "why would we use slides?"

**Build a document library.** Archive decision documents so that future teams can reference past reasoning. This creates institutional memory — something slide decks rarely provide because they are incomprehensible without the presenter.

**Iterate on the format.** After a year of practice, the organization will have developed its own conventions and best practices. Codify these and update the templates.

## Common Writing Pitfalls in Narrative Documents

| Pitfall | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Burying the lead | Three pages of context before the proposal | State the proposal in the introduction. Context supports the proposal; it does not precede it. |
| Weasel words | "We believe the market may potentially be ready for a solution in this space." | "The market is ready. Three signals support this: [specific evidence]." |
| Data without interpretation | "Customer satisfaction scores increased from 3.2 to 3.8." | "Customer satisfaction scores increased from 3.2 to 3.8, which moves us from the bottom quartile to the median for our industry segment." |
| Missing alternatives | The document presents one option as if it is the only option | Always include at least two alternatives and explain why they were rejected. |
| Circular reasoning | "We should build this because customers need it. Customers need it because it solves their problem. Their problem is that they do not have this." | Ground the argument in external evidence: customer research data, competitive analysis, market trends. |
| Assuming shared context | "As we discussed last quarter..." | Every document should stand alone. A reader with no prior context should be able to follow the argument. |
| Excessive hedging | "Results could potentially improve if market conditions remain favorable..." | Commit to a forecast and state the assumptions: "We project $2.1M in revenue, assuming 12% market growth and 3% conversion rate." |

## Measuring the Impact of Narrative Decision-Making

How do you know if the transition to narrative decision-making is working? Track these indicators:

**Leading indicators:**
- Time spent in decision meetings decreases (the silent reading protocol is more efficient than presentation plus Q&A)
- Number of follow-up meetings decreases (decisions are made in the first meeting because the document was complete)
- Quality of questions in meetings improves (specific, evidence-based questions rather than clarifying questions)
- Junior team members participate more actively in discussions

**Lagging indicators:**
- Fewer projects are approved and then reversed (decisions are more durable)
- Post-launch outcomes align more closely with pre-launch projections (analysis is more rigorous)
- Institutional knowledge improves (documents are searchable and referenceable; slides are not)

The narrative format is not a silver bullet. It does not guarantee good decisions. But it raises the floor. The worst narrative-based decision is better than the worst slide-based decision because the narrative format forces a minimum level of rigor that slide decks do not require.
